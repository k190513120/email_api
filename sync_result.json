Movie stars walk around the streets and nobody pays any attention to them at all, so no one is going to pay any attention to me.” — Ghislaine Maxwell 1997\r\nIn the ongoing challenge to override prevailing narrative that frames Ghislaine Maxwell as a monster defined solely by scandal, I offer an old article featuring her on the cusp of reinvention, rebounding after the death of her father. Pre Epstein. It’s rare to find anything in her own words. Like most I invest in, Ghislaine’s story deserves deeper nuance and critical reflection beyond the fragmented portrayals constructed for easy consumption, to serve a decided angle.\r\nThe article sheds light on a lot.\r\nAs Brief Backstory\r\nGhislaine Maxwell’s story begins with her father, Robert Maxwell. Born Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch into a poor Jewish family in war-ravaged Czechoslovakia, Robert endured unimaginable hardship. He joined the British Army in World War II, earning the Military Cross for bravery. But when the war ended, he returned to devastating news—nearly every member of his family had been murdered in the Holocaust.\r\nGrief birthed fuel for reinvention. Shedding his birth name and origins, he crafted a new identity: Robert Maxwell adopted a new name and carefully fashioned an upper class British accent, designed to infiltrate and dominate the world of publishing.\r\nHis efforts paid off.\r\n“I Bet She Wishes She Never Met Epstein”\r\nMaxwell emerged from the ruins of war as a bombastic figure, his piercing eyes relayed menacing charisma. Under his vision, he expanded the Daily Mirror into a sprawling media empire. Rupert Murdoch’s fiercest rival, etched the Maxwell name into the highest tiers of British society.\r\nAmid his towering ambition, Maxwell was desperate to rebuild his family shattered by war. He and his wife, Betty, a reserved French schooler, welcomed nine children. Their youngest, Ghislaine, was born on Christmas Day 1961—seen as a gift to fill the void left by the loss of their daughter Karine to leukemia at three.\r\nTragedy struck again days after Ghislaine’s birth. Their eldest son, Michael, was critically injured in a car crash. He lay in a coma for seven long years.\r\nIn her memoir, Betty admitted that grief hindered her capacity to care for her other children. Ghislaine’s early years were marked by her mother’s emotional neglect. Once she could finally speak, she approached her mother to say,“Mummy, I exist.” Betty explained it as a haunting plea for recognition that helped shake her out of clouded despair.\r\nTo compensate for their neglect, her parents indulged Ghislaine. She learned young to navigate and appease her father’s unpredictable mood swings and volatile temper. Archival footage captures her as a young hostess in training, mingling with ease among the glittering gowns and suited dignitaries all vying for her father’s favor.\r\nDespite their adoration, Robert’s fury was feared among the children. They lived in constant dread of incurring his wrath. One court record reveals a chilling incident: after a school-aged Ghislaine, obsessed with horses, nailed a poster above her bed on freshly painted walls. Her father responded to her defiance by pounding her hand with a hammer, leaving it swollen and bruised—as brutal lesson that decisions made under his roof without his approval would not be tolerated.\r\nMaxwell turned weekly family gatherings into trials—quizzing his children on memorized rules, exploding in anger when answers didn’t meet his standards, leaving the household “in utter distress.” \r\nAs adolescence took hold, Ghislaine leaned into a confident, flirtatious nature. Fluent in several languages by college, she viewed sex as a strategic tool for power and feminine advancement. At Oxford, she founded the Kit Kat Club—a social circle blending feminism with provocative matchmaking. Classmates recall her razor-sharp intellect, daring bravado, and unapologetic use of sex to entice and climb social ladders.\r\nA family reconciliation that coincided with her 20th birthday devolved into a painful Christmas, culminating in the announcement of her parents' separation.\r\nAfter Oxford, she launched a customized gifting business to serve Wall Street elites, including Donald Trump. She also worked closely with her father, often accompanying him to high-profile events, thriving in elite circles where philanthropy and hospitality expanded the Maxwell network, already a sprawling collection of famed contacts.\r\nHer social skills made her indispensable. Jeffrey Epstein recognized this immediately.\r\nAfter her father’s death, he drew Ghislaine into his orbit. Friends say she was madly in love and desperate to marry him. When that as a reality slipped away, she reinvented herself again, as indispensable handler managing his estates and meticulously orchestrating his social calendar to include the world’s most powerful figures.\r\nFrom there, everything hurtled toward destruction.\r\nGHISLAINE IN HER OWN WORDS \r\nQ: Despite all that has been written about your family, you have never given an interview until now. Why have you decided to do so?\r\nA: I didn't want to give an interview until now because I felt that anything I said would add to the already voluminous press coverage. It could also have been taken out of context and viewed as somewhat self-serving. Now there is no longer a trial, so hopefully whatever I say will be taken at face value. It is very nice to have the opportunity to say something in my own words, and it seems to me that this is the time and place to do it.\r\nQ: How long have you lived in New York?\r\nA: I moved here in 1991, originally to help with the US sales launch of The European. There was a launch event in October, and my father died in November.\r\nOn a tight budget in 1992, FOX flew Betty Maxwell to the city for an interview. She was not thrilled that it wasn’t first class. FOX assured Mrs. Maxwell she would be treated “like a queen” once she arrived in New York. Beforehand, Daphne approached Donald Trump to see if they could arrange for Mr. Maxwell to stay for free in a suite. Trump agreed—asking, as he would, “What’s in it for me?” FOX offered to promote Trump Plaza, featuring its entrance in the opening shot. Daphne recalls Betty Maxwell as very humble, still in a state of shock following her husband’s death. While in town, FOX hosted a dinner for her. Betty asked if she could bring her youngest daughter, Ghislaine, who had just moved to the city. Of course, they said—but with the reminder that Betty was the focus. Her daughter “wasn’t the scoop.”\r\nQ: Why did you stay in New York after he died?\r\nA: I thought I was going to help with some of the businesses like the Daily News and Macmillan Publishing. I imagined there would have been some role in which I could have been helpful to my family, but events unfolded and I found myself very quickly without a job.\r\nQ: You had to leave your expensive apartment on Central Park. Where did you go?\r\nA: It wasn't my apartment — I was renting it, and I had to find somewhere else to live. I found a very small studio about ten feet by ten feet. It was a box! The bed was up against one wall and, smack against the bed, was a little partition about six feet high. Behind it was a hob and sink — that was the kitchen. Next to it was a tiny bathroom, and that was it.\r\nQ: How did you feel at the time?\r\nA: Honestly, I didn't know what to think. It was a little confusing, to say the least. In fact, I am sure I was in a state of disbelief.\r\nQ: So how long have you been in this new apartment?\r\nA: It took me two years to afford to get out of the tiny studio, and I have been here for three years.\r\nQ: Do you own it?\r\nA: No, I rent it. I found it through friends. It is less stressful than going through real estate people.\r\nQ: You have been running your own business since your father died. How would you describe what you do?\r\nA: I do consulting work for different people in different areas in which I have expertise: publishing, communications, and computers. I enjoy the mechanics of business, and I enjoy working because it allows me to meet and interact with lots of different people. I have always worked and will always work. Today I also work out of necessity.\r\nI have a hobby which I have turned into a working hobby — I buy and sell antiques for various people. They give me some sense of what they are looking for, and I will go to the auction houses, antique shops, and flea markets to find it. I also represent some companies as well. I do PR for Robert label perfumes, a new company.\r\nLife at Headington Hall\r\nQ: Did you have to work before your father died, being in such a privileged position?\r\nA: Yes. My father always believed you had to earn your own keep.\r\nQ: Did you find it hard to live up to his expectations?\r\nA: My father had very high expectations, and if you attained one goal he would then have another, so you could never fulfil them because there would always be something else to strive for.\r\nQ: Do you take after your father?\r\nA: I have some physical resemblance: my eyebrows, his dark hair, his strong features — though I have my mummy's nose. Character-wise, my father was ambitious, determined, hard-working, and goal-driven. I like to think I share some of those qualities.\r\nQ: Someone once wrote that he was disappointed in you because you were not as ambitious. Did you ever fall out with him?\r\nA: Yes, we had a falling out, but it was only because he wanted me to work for him full time and I declined. My ambition has always been to work on my own and do my own thing.\r\nQ: Was it easy to work for your father when you were so close?\r\nA: My father wasn't an easy man to work for — for anybody. I wasn't given any special treatment; if anything, it was the opposite.\r\nQ: Did he ever praise you at all?\r\nA: Not very often. There was lots of stick and very little praise.\r\nQ: Did you find him intimidating?\r\nA: Well, he was very big, tall, and had a very loud voice, so that combination alone is a bit intimidating. He could be very demanding and tough. When he had something to say, you listened. It wasn't often that you would say “no” to him — “no” was not a word he would accept from someone else.\r\nQ: Did your opinion count in an argument?\r\nA: Having an argument with him was not something I would seek to do! I tried to avoid it if possible. If you had a difference of opinion, he would generally carry the day.\r\nQ: Do you feel that you are lacking in confidence?\r\nA: That is a tough question. At the time, my self-esteem took a battering, but I am an optimist by nature. Today I have confidence in my abilities and always think that I will win through — that is why I still strive. If I didn't think I could, I wouldn't.\r\nQ: What is your strongest memory of your relationship?\r\nA: His constant concern for my well-being. He always knew what I was doing, and he was always interested.\r\nQ: Did he offer advice?\r\nA: Well, he wasn't one of those people who just chit-chats — he was always very specific. If I asked, he would always give an opinion. I didn't always follow his advice, but I am sure he would have preferred it if I had.\r\nQ: Did you and he have a closer relationship than your other brothers and sisters?\r\nA: I am the youngest, and in most families the little one is always the one that gets more attention. So from that perspective, yes. But otherwise, my father had the same relationship with all of us — he was equally tough on everyone. He was equally a father to all of us.\r\nQ: But he called his yacht after you?\r\nA: I have a unique name, which is Norman French. I have been told it means “a ray of sunshine,” but I don't know if that is true. My parents tried to choose names for the children that would work in French and English, and by the ninth kid they gave up.\r\nQ: Calling the yacht Lady Ghislaine gives the impression that you were a favoured child.\r\nA: As I said, I was his youngest, so I was my father's little girl. If I were 80 and he were still around, I would still be his little girl. With parents, you reach a point where you don't grow up any more. He named the yacht after me in 1985, and there was a ceremony. It was a big surprise — I was very proud. I don't know how to describe something like that. It was great.\r\nQ: But your name became world-famous when your father died. Where were you at the time?\r\nA: I was in London. I was in the car when my brother Kevin called me and said he was missing. I didn't know what to think. He was missing and that was that — I wouldn't let my mind go down paths imagining the worst. I don't do that.\r\nQ: Where were you when the news came through that he had been found?\r\nA: I was at Kevin's house.\r\nQ: What was your immediate reaction?\r\nA: I was shocked — I couldn't believe it.\r\nQ: Did you believe it was him?\r\nA: He had been identified, so yes.\r\nQ: Philip and your mother went to Spain immediately. When did you join them?\r\nA: I flew out the next day. I had to borrow some clothes because I had very little with me in London. I went straight to the boat, where I met my mother and my brother. At that point, we had to deal with the police and the authorities.\r\nQ: Did you go down and identify the body?\r\nA: No, my mother and my brother went instead. I knew I was going to see him in public, covered in a shroud.\r\nQ: Why was he buried in Israel?\r\nA: Because he was Jewish and deeply committed to Israel and the Jewish people. He had a great love of Israel.\r\nQ: Were you surprised that he was given a state funeral?\r\nA: I don't think it was exactly a state funeral, but it was a big funeral, attended by heads of state and all the members of the Israeli Knesset. My father was Jewish, and I feel Jewish, although I am not Jewish. I consider that heritage a great part of my life, and it was something very important to my father. His family were murdered in the camps — that is not something you forget. It was a very important part of our lives. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go back to Israel since, but I hope to do so soon.\r\nQ: According to pathologists, your father's body was found floating, which isn't consistent with drowning. What do you think happened to him?\r\nA: I do not believe my father committed suicide. Apart from that, I don't know.\r\nQ: You are convinced of this?\r\nA: Yes. If he had committed suicide, he would have drowned — and he didn’t.\r\nQ: You can't commit suicide and not have any evidence of it.\r\nA: Much was made at the time of big financial problems, which is why the suicide theory came about. He didn't commit suicide because he didn't drown. There is no evidence of suicide. It was not unhelpful to certain parties that the suicide theory was put about, because it meant his life insurance policy would be in dispute.\r\nQ: But if he had a heart attack and fell overboard...\r\nA: There is no evidence that he had a heart attack.\r\nQ: But the Spanish doctors indicated he was taking some pills...\r\nA: I am unaware of any doctor indicating such a thing, and I do not believe he was doing so.\r\nQ: They said he had a medical problem that the family didn't want to reveal.\r\nA: That is simply not true.\r\nQ: So if you don't think he committed suicide, do you think it could have been an accident?\r\nA: Well, it could either have been an accident or it could have been murder.\r\nQ: What do you think?\r\nA: I think he was murdered.\r\nQ: Why?\r\nA: I can't see my father going to the side of a boat and dipping off the side. It is too easy to fall off the side of a boat. One thing I am sure about is that he did not commit suicide. This was just not consistent with his character.\r\nQ: Kevin has said on television he thinks your father's death was an accident, so is yours just a personal theory?\r\nA: I am not the only person in the family who thinks this. I can't discuss it further, however, because there is currently litigation pending about my father's life insurance.\r\nQ: Did what happened to your father's companies come as a shock to you?\r\nA: I had no idea what was happening. I was following events via the press.\r\nQ: Did anyone ring you up and warn you what was about to happen?\r\nA: No.\r\nQ: You weren't as involved as your brothers in the Maxwell Group. What was your role in your father's companies?\r\nA: At its height, I had eight or nine people working for me.\r\nQ: You were young to be running a new publishing company. Did you feel confident because you had somebody behind you who could solve any problems?\r\nA: I didn't think like that — I just did it. I'm very independent, and I always seek to do whatever I do on my own because I get pleasure out of doing it myself. So I wouldn't start something by thinking: Oh good, I can go back and check with my father if necessary.\r\nQ: Were you the editor?\r\nA: No, I wasn't — I don't remember whether I had any title. I had my own business at that time called Maxwell's Corporate Gifts, which did corporate gifts and dealt with long-service awards. It did some work for the Maxwell Group, but the majority of clients were outside the group. I loved it. I was 24 when I started it, after I left Oxford University.\r\nQ: How old were you when your father first made you work?\r\nA: I was very young. I worked in the post room, photocopying room, and answering the phones at Pergamon Press at Headington Hall, where we lived. I would be serving peanuts, serving drinks, and washing up afterwards.\r\nQ: Were you paid for this?\r\nA: I got sweetie money, so I could buy my favourite Cadbury's chocolates — and that was limited so I wouldn't buy too much of it.\r\nQ: You have been accused of living off a trust fund between £80,000 and £100,000. Is this true?\r\nA: No, absolutely not.\r\nQ: Have you ever had one?\r\nA: No, my father always made us work for everything. I do not have a trust fund.\r\nQ: You have been accused of being a shopaholic, and a newspaper once claimed you spent $20,000 a month on your credit card. What do you suppose is the basis of these comments?\r\nA: We can probably put that down to one of the many exaggerations and fantasies that have been written about me in the past. Supposedly, one of my friends told this to a journalist, but I find that hard to believe as I can't think of anyone I know who would say such a thing. It is utterly false. Given free time, there are many things I prefer to do over shopping. I am particularly into yoga. Frankly, I am happier reading a good book than shopping.\r\nQ: Was there a time five or ten years ago when you did buy designer clothes?\r\nA: I have a few pieces — not many — but I have never been into shopping, especially not for designer clothes.\r\nQ: In most photos you always seem elegant and well-groomed. Does this mean that everyone assumes you…?\r\nA: I know people who have no money at all who always turn themselves out really wonderfully and look great, and I know people with lots of money and wonderful clothes who don't look as wonderful as those without money. I don't think having money necessarily means you are elegant and well-turned-out. You can't control what people think.\r\nQ: Does having the name Maxwell afford you certain privileges, or does it have its drawbacks?\r\nA: The main drawback is the press. The advantages are whatever you make of them.\r\nQ: Have you had any doors slammed in your face that wouldn't have been otherwise?\r\nA: No. People have treated me fairly and kindly.\r\nQ: Your father was called a bully in court. Would you agree with that?\r\nA: He was very tough and he could be quite scary. If the definition of a bully is someone who is bigger and stronger than you, well, he was big and strong.\r\nQ: He was called “Captain Crook” in court. How do you react to that?\r\nA: When someone is dead, people can say whatever they like about that person. You can't control what people say. Obviously, I can think of other nicknames I would have preferred over that one.\r\nQ: Were there any surprising sides to his character?\r\nA: He gave wonderful bear hugs. I miss my hugs from my father. He also had a great sense of humour and was kind.\r\nQ: But he could also be very cruel, like sacking your brother when he was late picking him up from the airport?\r\nA: Yes, he had both sides. There was the loving daddy side and the tougher side. But people don't know that he had a great sense of humour. He loved jokes, and that is one of the things we shared in common. I collect jokes. I make them up, too. I go to stand-up comedy a lot here in New York.\r\nQ: Do you miss him?\r\nA: Yes, I do miss him because he was my father. A child always expects to outlive her parents, but there is no way to prepare for the loss when it occurs, especially under circumstances such as these. There are times in my life when I wish he was here. If I meet someone who is interesting, if I read a good book, or if I do something I think he would be proud of or appreciate — in the past I could, and now I can't. Yet I feel very strongly that my father is with me. I can hear what he would say. I know how he would respond to certain things.\r\nWhen I am trying to resolve an issue or come up with a solution, I will mentally place him there and try to understand what he might say to me so he could give me some advice. I have some videos of him, so if I have a moment when I miss him, I can put the video on and have him in the room with me.\r\nQ: And do you cry?\r\nA: Sometimes. I try very hard not to let my grief show in public places, but I am definitely prone to tears at home. Sometimes if I am sad or watching a weepy movie, I can go through a box of tissues.\r\nQ: Do people ask you about your father?\r\nA: They ask me in general terms, mainly if I miss him. Friends and family who knew him and know me well do ask me about him, and I am thrilled to talk to them about him because it can be fun. Some people have anecdotes that I don't know, and I love hearing their stories and enjoy talking to them about him. With people who don't know him, I don't discuss him. I avoid the subject.\r\nQ: Do you miss your family?\r\nA: Yes, because they are incredibly far away and it makes lunch dates very difficult. But they do come here on business from time to time.\r\nQ: Are you closest to Kevin and Ian?\r\nA: We went to the same schools and we are the closest in age, so I spent more time with them. But I am close to all my brothers and sisters. We are a very friendly family. They are really, really nice people and I like them very much. I have fun with them and I enjoy their company.\r\nQ: Did you go over to Britain during the court case?\r\nA: No, hardly ever.\r\nQ: How did you react when your brothers were accused of fraud?\r\nA: I was shocked.\r\nQ: Did you think they would be acquitted?\r\nA: Of course. With the evidence, I couldn't see how the jury would come to any other conclusion.\r\nQ: Where were you when the news came through?\r\nA: I was here, they rang me. I was very relieved it was over.\r\nQ: Do you feel a chapter has closed?\r\nA: I am very pleased that proceedings are over and I hope they can now be left alone to make a life, because for five years they couldn't do it. My hope for them is that they can get back to some form of normal life and they can work.\r\nQ: Kevin said that he didn't blame your father for what happened. Do you blame him?\r\nA: I think if my father had lived, the events that unfolded would not have unfolded in the manner they did, and as I don't believe he controlled the moment of his death, I can't blame him either.\r\nQ: Have you come to terms with everything that has happened and, if so, how?\r\nA: What is past is past. You can't dwell on it. You have to move on, and I move on by working every day. You can’t keep going back.\r\nQ: Did humour keep you going when it was really tough?\r\nA: You have to have a sense of humour when things go wrong. I love to laugh. They say if you smile at yourself in the mirror it makes you feel better — I believe that. You have to laugh sometimes or it can be very, very sad. I am an optimist and find a positive light in everything.\r\nQ: Do you miss England?\r\nA: I love England. My friends and family are there, and I miss things about home, like Cadbury's chocolate, English taxi drivers, the sausages, bacon, milk — it’s quite different here. I miss the countryside; I love the smells, particularly of grass. It’s home — I grew up there. It’s magnificent and wonderful. I go back as often as I can, when I have business.\r\nQ: Do you find you have more privacy in America?\r\nA: The American press is different from the English press — less sensational and less intrusive into people's private lives. It doesn't matter who you are here, you are afforded more privacy just from the way the press handles itself. So yes.\r\nQ: Can you be anonymous here?\r\nA: America is a big country and there are lots of really famous people here. Movie stars walk around the streets and nobody pays any attention to them at all, so no one is going to pay any attention to me.\r\nQ: And how about in England?\r\nA: I go home and I don't find that people are pointing at me. Occasionally people do recognise me, but when they do they are very nice and friendly.\r\nQ: Are you treated differently because you are Robert Maxwell's daughter?\r\nA: When I meet people who don't know me, they react to me, not to who my father was. They respond to me as an individual, not to my family story.\r\nQ: Do people still introduce you as Ghislaine, the daughter of Robert Maxwell?\r\nA: That still does happen. But it's the truth — I am who I am. I am the daughter of Robert Maxwell, but when I am introduced to people as his daughter they don't respond to the Maxwell, they respond to me. They probably never met him and likely don't know very much about him, so their reaction can only be to me.\r\nHe was very big, tall, and had a very loud voice, so that combination alone is a bit intimidating. When he had something to say, you listened.\r\nQ: Do you think you are a different person from the one you would have been if your life had gone on the way it was?\r\nA: I think I am much more empathetic with other people's problems. If I find someone has a problem, I feel for them. Certainly, if someone tells me they have lost a parent, I fully understand the grief and sorrow they experience — something I couldn’t have done before. Friends come to me more with problems, and I have more time for people who are suffering in one way or another now than I might have had in the past, because I have been there. I make them coffee or just give them a hug, because if someone is not happy, I have time — as much time as they need. My friends were very nice to me when I needed their support, and I appreciated it very much.\r\nQ: Do you plan to settle in the States?\r\nA: It has always been possible that I will go back to England. It is all to do with work — I will go wherever the business is.\r\nQ: Would you ever consider giving up business for marriage?\r\nA: I don't believe that you necessarily have to choose between the two. I have always thought that one day I would get married and have kids, but it has never been a focus. It is not something I have set out to do. My focus is my business, but one day I would also like to get married and have kids.\r\nQ: Have you ever gone through a broody stage?\r\nA: I love children — my nieces and nephews, my godchildren — but I have to accomplish more before I feel able to have children. I am not ready. I want to be in a position where I can really focus on a child and do the best for that child, and I don't feel that I am in that position now.\r\nQ: Would you prefer to bring up a child in the States or in England?\r\nA: I’m not sure I’ll have an option. It depends who I marry and where I live.\r\nQ: Has it been easy for you to have successful relationships with men?\r\nA: Strong women who are independent can be somewhat intimidating to certain types of men, but I have had successful relationships. I’ve always grown up with men—I had three brothers, went to a co-ed school—Marlborough—which had 1,000 boys and 30 girls. Then I went to a predominantly male college, Balliol at Oxford, so I’ve always had men friends.\r\nQ: Did the thought of having to face a father like yours put off a lot of potential boyfriends?\r\nA: I’m sure every boyfriend dreads meeting a new girlfriend’s father!\r\nQ: Do you find it difficult to trust people?\r\nA: I’ve always been quite careful, and if anything, the events of the last few years have just reinforced that tendency. It’s always best to be careful and measured because you don’t always know what people want. So I listen and I am cautious.\r\nQ: At what point did everything you went through really hit you?\r\nA: This is an ongoing process. It still affects me.\r\nQ: Is it getting any easier?\r\nA: The death of a parent is something you deal with all the time. It doesn’t go away. It gets less with time, and you adjust, but it’s always with you.\r\nQ: How close are you to your mother?\r\nA: Very close. I like to think we give each other support. She is a wonderful woman—very wise, highly intelligent, and artistic. She writes, paints, and plays music. She currently gives lectures on the Holocaust and Jewish-Christian relations and was a visiting lecturer at Penn State University last year. She’s considered an authority in that area. Since my father died, she has become more active in this field because it’s her passion and her job now.\r\nQ: Do you feel it’s unfair that she has to go out to work at 76?\r\nA: I think it’s difficult, but it is what it is.\r\nQ: Is she a strong woman?\r\nA: She is very strong and has done very well. She was head of the Jewish parade here in New York last year—the first Gentile and first woman to do that. I was very proud of her and the way she works today. She’s great.\r\nQ: It seems a little ironic that you go to Sotheby’s to buy things at auction when all your family possessions were sold at auction after your father’s death. How do you feel?\r\nA: It was not one of the highlights! The auction included little gifts I had given my father, like a photo frame, a pen, or a tie. I would have liked to buy some mementoes but I didn’t because I didn’t have the means.\r\nQ: How do you see your future?\r\nA: I am optimistic about my future and believe things will continue to improve as time passes.\r\nIan and Kevin Maxwell were arrested and charged in 1992 in connection with the massive Mirror Group pension fraud, but after an eight-month trial they were acquitted of all charges in January 1996\r\nRelated: Ghislaine Maxwell's 'lieutenant' lives the high life in $6.5M Miami condo  [ https://substack.com/redirect/c418d64e-4dc9-4254-9ee5-cb1d05b23ea3?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]as her boss still stuck behind bars\r\nDaily Mail can reveal an exclusive glimpse inside the gilded lifestyle enjoyed by Kellen, 46, who spent around a decade working as Epstein's personal assistant and was dubbed his lieutenant in court papers.\r\nKellen's luxe bolt hole has been a $6.5million apartment at the ultra-exclusive Continuum condo complex in Miami Beach where she rubs shoulders with billionaires and celebs.\r\nThe 12-acre compound boasts round the clock security and amenities worthy of a five-star resort, including a 'world class' spa, two pools, professional tennis courts, a club, restaurant and private beach.\r\nI asked Daphne Barack about her latest piece on Maxwell [ https://substack.com/redirect/5c54d042-850b-461b-9155-0e496174c911?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] published nearly 30 years after meeting her\r\n“It was on the front page, promoting my Fox TV interview with Betty Maxwell and Ghislaine, which ran for two days.

Many startups employing FDEs use them to help win customers. Basically, when a customer is undecided on whether they can effectively use a product, Sales offers to provide an FDE to help them successfully integrate it. Here’s how Ramp puts it [ https://substack.com/redirect/de3d7443-c820-4481-be5d-72af3288ca1e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] in a job ad:\r\n“Collaborate closely with our sales and go-to-market teams to close exciting deals, activate customers, and expand the value Ramp provides over time”.\r\nEmbed into customers’ teams. As an OpenAI advert says [ https://substack.com/redirect/69107b55-e2f5-4bf3-8781-8e4783d38eea?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], “As an FDE, you’ll embed with customers, understand their domain, and co-develop solutions to tackle real problems in often undefined or evolving problem spaces”.\r\nIt’s pretty standard that the job involves travelling to customers to sit alongside them a few times. Palantir expects [ https://substack.com/redirect/9fe766c4-5e80-4dda-ac32-4b5401729d26?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] around 25% of FDEs’ time to be spent onsite with customers, and healthcare AI company Commure estimates [ https://substack.com/redirect/9fe766c4-5e80-4dda-ac32-4b5401729d26?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] up to 50%.\r\nFor businesses that work with unusual customers, this can involve working in harder-to-access work environments. For example, industrial AI startup Matta expects [ https://substack.com/redirect/f06e0475-7420-4cb6-b12d-bce35c58d506?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] FDEs to “scope out solutions on the factory floor”.

Not typical workplaces!\r\nContribute to the core product, and embed with core product engineering teams. As Ramp describes, FDEs are expected to:\r\n“Drive their core product engineering roadmap and make important prioritization and scoping decisions that determine when we build custom solutions vs. accelerate larger existing projects. Ramp’s team uses an embedding model where FDEs embed within core product engineering teams to develop expertise in the most relevant technical areas”.\r\nHelp customers succeed. The core of the role is to make customers successful by building on top of a company’s product offering. As robotics startup Gecko Robotics phrases it [ https://substack.com/redirect/e99c6bba-7e9a-4efd-9f46-459812174f98?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: “[FDEs] search for the highest-impact problems we can find, we spend a lot of time with customers to understand their true nature, we come up with new [approaches], and we don’t quit until we’ve reached impact”.\r\nSome places treat the role as more of a technical consultant. AI agent management platform Lindy expects [ https://substack.com/redirect/f8480d4a-d4fa-4d30-a6ad-65194066953f?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] FDEs to help customers build and maintain their no-code workflows, “while serving as their technical consultant”. It’s evident the line between being a consultant and an engineer who works both with the customer and on the product, can be blurred.\r\nEvery company has their own flavor of FDE. This role is quite new, meaning workplaces define their own expectations of it. Some put more emphasis on FDEs closing sales pipelines, others on assisting customers, and some focus on contributing to the core product.\r\nIt looks as if the role comes loaded up with expectations; for example, here is what a Senior FDE is expected to do at Salesforce [ https://substack.com/redirect/b1a04602-d56c-4e0e-82b3-7d45431bf6b6?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]:\r\nDrive tangible outcomes through hands-on implementation\r\nBuild transformative AI solutions\r\nEngineer bespoke agentic AI solutions\r\nOwn the entire data configuration & integration lifecycle\r\nProactively remove technical blockers\r\nDrive Agentforce innovation\r\nBecome a trusted strategic partner\r\nConduct deep-dive technical debugging and root cause analysis\r\nLead rapid prototyping and iteration\r\nImplement and enforce best practices\r\nThat’s quite the list, and looks similar to implicit expectations upon an experienced software engineer – usually at the Senior+ levels. I personally like Palantir’s definition [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7974893-de20-469d-b135-d10ce477eea3?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] which encapsulates all this:\r\n“FDEs responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams and own end-to-end execution of high-stakes projects.”\r\nRoles that are highly similar to an FDE can be called different things. “Agent engineer”, “Solutions Architect”, “Sales Engineer”, and “Technical Delivery Engineer” all come pretty close to what Forward Deployed Engineers do. The difference comes down to that FDEs work with customers and also contribute to the product their company sells.\r\nHere’s my own mental model of what an FDE typically is – with the caveat that the “platform engineer” part might be less emphasized at places where FDEs do not contribute to the product:\r\n2. Origins\r\nThe “Forward Deployed Software Engineer” role was created at data mining giant Palantir in the early 2010s, and was named “Delta.” Palantir was founded in 2003 and provides services to government agencies like law enforcement and the military, and to private companies. The data it works with is often sensitive and proprietary.\r\nUp until circa 2016, Palantir had more FDEs than it had “normal” software engineers. That year, a product called Palantir Foundry [ https://substack.com/redirect/4778c9be-b348-475d-a814-19c63e6686b1?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] was launched: an integrated data platform built for commercial and civil government sectors. From then on, more FDEs went back to working as software engineers, working on Foundry and bringing their experience from the field to that core product.\r\nEven today, no company employs more FDEs than Palantir, and no startup or scaleup comes close to influencing the role as much. Here’s how Palantir explains [ https://substack.com/redirect/f1bf8c5a-87cd-4380-bd28-9c496d31d1e4?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] it in more detail:\r\n“Deltas (Forward Deployed Software Engineers) deploy our software platforms to customers. Deltas are part of Business Development, and their mandate is to achieve technical outcomes for our customers.\r\nAs part of a team that directly supports one customer, a Delta focuses on technology-driven value creation: deploying and customizing Palantir platforms to tackle critical business problems. They measure success in terms of impact on the customer’s goal. For example, we work with manufacturers who want to reduce the number of defective products coming off the assembly line. To move the needle on that metric, a Delta uses Palantir products, a variety of languages, open-source tooling, and industry-standard build tooling, and their own creativity to devise a solution.\r\nYou can think of a Dev’s focus as “one capability, many customers,” while a Delta’s focus is “one customer, many capabilities”.\r\nFDEs are sometimes mistakenly thought of as consultants, but the difference between consultants and FDEs is that the former make one-off recommendations, whereas FDEs generally work with customers, long-term.\r\nAs mentioned, FDEs also contribute to core products. When there’s a capability missing that a customer needs, the FDE can do the “dev” work of adding features and improvements to Palantir’s product.\r\nDay-to-day as an FDE at Palantir\r\nTwo FDEs at Palantir shared [ https://substack.com/redirect/f1bf8c5a-87cd-4380-bd28-9c496d31d1e4?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] what a typical day looked like, back in 2019:\r\n“Dyon (Abu Dhabi): “Most weeks, I spend a couple of days working at the customer premises, some of that time in meetings with technical or business stakeholders, and the rest of the time monitoring, debugging, deploying, or configuring our software for that customer.\r\nBack in the office, I spend some time writing minor code changes, reviewing pull requests, and researching/planning customer solutions.\r\nThe remainder of my time is spent communicating via email or VTC with our internal support and product development teams, and with my direct reports who are based in a number of remote offices.\r\nG.M. (São Paulo): “My ‘day-to-day’ changes month-to-month, which is a cool feature of my role! Some weeks, I spend most of my time developing and reviewing my team’s code, like a typical software engineer. Other weeks, I spend most of my time scoping the future of a project with a client, or working with users to make sure the things we’ve built meet their needs.”\r\nIn general, a typical week for FDEs at Palantir is a mix of:\r\nProject work for a customer: the primary focus\r\nImproving Palantir’s platform/systems: when Palantir’s platform gets in the way of building functionality, FDEs do things like configure new data models, contribute stability improvements, or commit fixes to the platform\r\nKeep up with internal tasks: internal comms, emails, meetings, standups, meeting coworkers, shared projects, etc.\r\nThe above may seem to describe two separate jobs (working similar to a consultant / working as a platform engineer) rolled into one! This is the tricky nature of the role: the ability to say “no” is part of doing well in this position, according [ https://substack.com/redirect/acfd6c87-436e-430e-93bd-78556438fd9e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] to an FDE at Palantir said:\r\n“I generally try to limit the amount of time I spend in meetings by asking myself “does this discussion have to be a meeting, and do I have to be there?” Most people at the company take a similar approach, and it leads to a situation where every meeting I attend ends up being a productive use of my time.”\r\nWhy does Palantir employ so many FDEs?\r\nPalantir works a lot with government agencies and companies that I’d consider “traditional”. I suspect that without a role like FDE, these more traditional businesses would struggle to integrate Palantir’s system into theirs.\r\nIn contrast, startups are nimble, employ devs who are usually open to experimentation and don’t mind “hacking\" solutions together. But large enterprises are often the opposite; where getting things done is less about technology challenges than bureaucracy, and a “not my job” mindset gets in the way of projects.\r\nBy sending in empowered engineers whose mission is to integrate Palantir’s software in a way that delivers customer value, Planatir “kills two birds with one stone”: they don’t need to worry too much about internal bureaucracy because they are blissfully unaware of it, and they send a “startup-minded” dev for the integration with the mindset of “how can I get this to work”, not “what are reasons this won’t work.” Companies contracting with Palantir see faster progress in software integration than by doing it themselves.\r\n3. The FDE role at OpenAI\r\nColin Jarvis [ https://substack.com/redirect/08f88ec8-61fd-4d93-866e-1d2ab91b7846?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] is Head of Forward Deployed Engineering at OpenAI. He initially joined in 2022 as a Solutions Architect, and became the Head of Solutions Architecture, last year. At the beginning of this year, Colin presented a business case for setting up a Forward Deployed Engineering Team, to have a more targeted offering. The group started with two FDEs, and today there are more than 10 at the company in:\r\nUS: New York and San Francisco\r\nEurope: Dublin, London, Munich, Paris\r\nAsia: Tokyo and Singapore\r\nOpenAI still has a “Solutions Architect” (SA) role. Both SAs and FDEs help with the challenge of LLMs being complicated for customers to work with.\r\nFDEs are more hands-on and typically work with more ambiguity than SAs traditionally do. SAs are more like advisory roles: they rarely write code on customers’ infrastructure, and usually build minimum viable products (MVPs), or proofs of concept (PoC) with anonymized or offline cuts of data.\r\nFDEs are much more hands-on: they write code directly on customer infrastructure and use customer tooling for this. FDEs also align with OpenAI’s research objectives, and work with customers who can most likely build solutions that help advance the research direction at OpenAI. FDEs need to work with more ambiguity than traditional cloud solution architects.\r\nFDEs help advance the product roadmap. In one case, OpenAI worked with a voice customer on call center automation, and FDEs created evals on the voice model. Initially, the model wasn’t performing well enough for the customer to commit to deploying it.\r\nSo, the FDE team went back to OpenAI’s research department with data and worked on improving the model’s performance for voice use cases, leading the customer to be the first to deploy the advanced solution in production.\r\nOpenAI’s Realtime API [ https://substack.com/redirect/8696b3cc-7015-405d-bcb9-b1738bf77689?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] was also improved by this work. In the end, it was a win-win: the customer got a more advanced capability faster thanks to FDEs, and OpenAI got to test improvement with a real-world case, and improve the product for all customers.\r\nWork structure at OpenAI\r\nColin explained how their FDE team thinks about the parallel dimensions of their job:\r\nCustomer-facing-FDE work structure\r\nCustomer projects have three phases:\r\nEarly scoping (phase #1) A couple of days onsite with the customer\r\nSit with users, map out their processes\r\nIdentify the biggest value areas\r\nPrototype with synthetic data\r\nWhiteboard ideas and prioritize them\r\nValidation (phase #2). FDEs land on the customer’s site and answer this question: “Is what we scoped out, the most valuable thing we can do for the customer?” If so, they agree on validation criteria.

We want to bias for moving fast, proving out any brick walls and then adjusting the scope to the most useful thing we can do, given any insurmountable constraints.”\r\nDelivery (phase #3).

They helped solve the problem of scaling “personalized farmer interventions”. Previously, the customer made phone calls manually to farmers, giving them tips and suggestions on how to make best use of their farming equipment.\r\nBut the customer wanted farmers to get personalized insights to maximize utilization of their latest weed control technology which reduced the amount of pesticide sprayed on crops, saving significant sums.\r\nAs part of the project, both Colin and an FDE travelled to Iowa, and worked directly with farmers.\r\nThe timing of the project was tight: John Deere wanted the new feature to be ready for the next growing season, when crop planting is done and effective spraying is critical. The team was able to pull off the integration within this tight time frame, and the project was considered a success.\r\nInternal-facing-FDE work structure\r\nWhile the main focus of FDEs is working on customer projects, they also share knowledge with OpenAI and work with internal teams:\r\nRegular knowledge-sharing sessions with the Research team, usually bi-weekly\r\nFortnightly readouts with OpenAI’s Head of Product and Product Managers\r\n“FDE Field notes” Slack channel, where any and all FDEs share insights in an internally public channel\r\nQuarterly bootcamps that bring the whole FDE team together.

]”这期电话录音播客，就有了解我在情绪低谷时，会很容易想要躲避一切，也切断与外界的一切。当时情绪不好的我马上就要出发游荡，和莫不谷，粽子，Ruya集合。从每一次过往的游荡经验来看，我能预想到游荡之旅快乐，精彩，我也能预想到自己在游荡过程中会恢复活力，精神，展现出好的状态。但我就因为知道会变好，反而产生了恐惧和一些抗拒。我想放过自己，不想再让自己辛苦，失望，便有一种强烈的情绪冲动要把提前好久定的机票行程全部取消，即使造成金钱损失，或者需要和朋友沟通，也比好了以后状态又变糟糕来的要好。\r\n现在人在荷兰的我回想过去这一段，我想说，“那时你想错了，幸好你决定出门。”游荡路上，莫不谷和我分享她看到的一个帖子，在《恶作剧之吻》里扮演留农的台湾明星刘容嘉在庆祝自己42岁生日的时候写到，“今天來到地球42年了，常常也有碎掉的時候，今天突然有個感覺，那些碎掉的東西不是真的，只是我內在投射出來的幻相，因為真實的東西是碎不了的，既然如此，就讓他碎掉吧!”\r\n（刘容嘉的生日ins）\r\n我在游荡出发前那段感受到害怕，恐惧，孤立，绝望的时刻不是真的，它们也不能让我真的碎掉。人不能在自我感受碎掉的时候选择放弃。什么是放弃呢？我想，逃避，退缩，离开，这些看起来熟悉，有着令我情绪安心的确定性，是放弃，放弃迎接生活，放弃拥抱可能，放弃新的自我生发。放弃是一条看起来容易却越走越艰难的路，面对是一条看起来艰难，但只要上路，会越走越轻松的路。放弃只需要做一个动作，放弃，但面对，主动解决问题需要一系列积极的动作，既要有精神动力对抗负面情绪，又要有实际的行动力，做起来并不容易，但对拯救自我而言，是正确的，对自己真正有帮助的选择。\r\n刚开始抗拒，甚至想要放弃这次游荡行程的我，现在不仅因为荷兰夏日凉爽不想走，还定了10月再来荷兰的机票，甚至明年7月再来荷兰的计划，现在荷兰已经当之无愧成为我来过次数最多的欧洲国家，也因为莫不谷的各种讲解“导游”，我对荷兰的熟悉了解甚至超过荷兰本地人（一些夸张）。\r\n其实今年四月复活节我就已经来荷兰度过了绿意盎然的春天，这次7月再来荷兰，是恰巧得知我在荷兰的研究生同学是云贵川菜高手，莫不谷便组了一个云贵川美食盛宴的女性聚会，粽子也被美食吸引过来，于是在结束瑞士米兰行程后，粽子、我跟着莫不谷一起飞回荷兰，开启了荷兰长达一周多的游荡，除了云贵川美食盛宴，还安排了去阿姆斯特丹看梵高，去鹿特丹参加无限夏日加勒比狂欢节，还偶遇了Free Fashion，每人可以免费选3件衣物，去海牙参加飞地书店酷儿观影，看博物馆，又一起吃欧洲最好吃的正宗新疆大盘鸡，去乌特勒支美到惊人的德哈尔童话城堡散步野餐，在米菲的家乡乌特勒支市中心闲逛，让我一时难以区分海牙和乌特在我心里究竟谁更美，还第一次去了奈梅亨这个城市，竟意外五折买到了我最近急需又非常好穿的亚瑟士运动鞋，并且计划明年来奈梅亨参加世界最大的四日徒步活动，如果我的运动鞋能支撑到明年，我就穿着奈梅亨买的运动鞋来奈梅亨徒步，莫不谷到时候第一天来给我们加油，最后一天来给我们喝彩。粽子听说了荷兰国王节吊单杠100秒就有机会获得一百欧元时，决定回芬兰强身健体，说不准就有机会赢得这比奖金。\r\n由于荷兰夏天太舒服，二十多度的温度凉爽宜人，森林植被茂密还很少有蚊虫，加上莫不谷等朋友们都在荷兰，我就不想回西班牙一个人过三十多度的热夏。于是我决定在荷兰找找打工换宿的机会，既可以留在荷兰，还不用花钱，最理想的是去遛狗，做我有兴趣且做起来不累的事。\r\n结果刚好找到了一个荷兰女性host，目前离婚单身，带着三个孩子，在孩子外出和爸爸度假期间，她需要人手帮忙搭建鸡窝，花园除草，打扫卫生，投喂猫咪，每天上午工作，中间coffee time休息，下午和周末都是自由时间，可以森林徒步，骑行，自行安排，期间host提供食宿。虽然这个项目没有我最想干的遛狗，但刚好和我的时间匹配，又能解决食宿，而且还是女性（不考虑任何男性host项目），我就出发去了。\r\n第一次打工换宿的体验不仅没有想象的困难反而收获太多意外之喜。首先是语言沟通，我的英文沟通只有基础日常，host虽然是荷兰人但英文相当流利且清晰，我每天用蹩脚英文交流沟通，感觉自己听说都有明显提高，而host也说这是她第一次和中国人有这么深入的交流，因为之前遇到的中国人可能会英文但不敢开口，很难有更多的交流，开口很关键，说错了再修正就是。对于学习倦怠的我来说，这种在日常生活中学习的方法不仅没有学习的抵触情绪，而且没有学习带来的压力，是一个能减少很多痛苦的学习语言的方法。\r\n其次是美食体验，我原本做好了每天白人饭的准备，对荷兰本地人的厨艺不抱有任何期待，没想到见面第一晚，host做的南瓜汤，蒜香炒饭，蘑菇炒面都惊人的好吃，完全符合亚洲人胃口，加上每日咖啡，牛奶，水果，饮料，饭前甜品零食，饭后冰淇淋自助，晚上还有tea time一起喝茶聊天，感觉自己像是老鼠掉进蜜缸里。更重要的是在打工换宿的这段时间，自己意外得到很多recover。\r\n打工换宿期间，我总是忍不住想多做点活，给host搭把手，但host却常常劝我别多干，多休息。在我主动要刷碗时，host说几个人一起吃的饭，你自己刷我觉得不舒服，放在那里稍晚我们一起干我会感觉更好。host外出度假，我在家独自看家干活时，host很满意我的工作成果，下一句就是问，有没有balance工作和休息，如果我不能充分享受自己的时间，就必须一起沟通解决这个问题，因为她希望我能充分休息，充分享受属于自己的时间和生活。host的每次询问，都像是一次提醒，除了physical work，你有做到好好休息吗？你有享受自己的时间吗？不要忽略你自己的感受和你的生活。\r\nhost家里养了两只迷你矮脚鸡，其中有一只鸡因为伙伴去世而抑郁，总是呆在窝里不出来，所以host让我每天白天把鸡放出来散步放风，喂水喂食物，还会喂面包虫补充蛋白质。鸡窝里孩子们种了一棵榛子树苗，为了保护树苗，也尊重理解鸡喜欢刨土挖虫的本性，就给树苗也修了栅栏。host住在森林度假露营区，附近都是森林，交通不是很便利，为了方便我在自由时间探索，host便帮我找了一辆自行车，还给我推荐骑行路线，当我骑着自行车去森林里放风时，我感觉我在照顾depressed的鸡，host在照顾depressed的我。\r\n事实上，在这个家呆几天，你就会发现任何有生命的物体在这里都能感受到自由，爱意和尊重。家里的小猫Tiger，除了猫窝猫砂盆，小朋友亲手给它做了纸箱，画上了老虎的手工标识，还给它送了老虎的长抱枕，让它睡的舒服。Tiger每天猫粮和水不断，晚上还有肉罐头，三天消耗一罐，但host说，可以多给它，因为小猫也会馋。Tiger是自由且享受野外的猫咪（已绝育），为了给它提供便利，host在里外两道门里分别安装了猫门🚪，让它进出自由，也因此晚上Tiger常常骄傲地分享打猎成果，把我吓得半死，host还在家里墙上给猫咪装了猫抓板玩，当然整个家都是Tiger的大型猫抓板，想抓哪里抓哪里。\r\n还有这个家的小朋友，打工换宿期间她们不在家，但我能处处感受到孩子被充分地关爱。十几岁的孩子下午两点就放学，然后host挨个接三个孩子送她们去同学家朋友家玩。度假屋院子里很大一块区域布置了滑滑梯，跳床，各种玩具，还搞了一个泳池每天过滤自来水，想让孩子能有夏日泳池。在我除草的时候，host交待，注意保护孩子种的幸运四叶草，别因为不起眼被割掉。在我搭建鸡窝的时候，host交待，希望小朋友每天方便进出和鸡玩，最好考虑儿童安全和方便。聊天的时候，host说会让孩子多去森林野外，让她们接触户外和真实的世界，也让她们知道（才知道荷兰有儿童友好的naked 露营区）人就是有高矮胖瘦，人的身体是会变化的，通过这样的教育，让孩子们避免社交媒体偶像带来的身材焦虑。\r\n打工换宿的体验一切都看起来很美好，我的认真努力也让host非常满意，甚至主动邀请我10月再来帮她看家，那时候她要带小朋友去摩洛哥度假。然而就在结束的前一天，我闯了一个大祸，差点把host家厨房给烧了。事情是中午我打算做个炒肉丝，当我将切好的蒜放进平底锅里时，热了太久火力太足的锅遇到还有水的蒜，立刻冒起来一米高的火焰，这是我这辈子见过最高的火焰，把我吓得立刻关掉燃气，正当我回过神要善后时，烟雾报警器立刻响个不停，于是我赶忙给host打电话说明情况，在她的指导下关闭了报警器，又赶紧把现场情况拍视频发给她，承诺尽最大努力清理现场。运气很好的是，厨房和头顶只有一层薄薄的黑烟，加点洗洁精清洁一新，没有造成任何损失。但这件事让我心有余悸，接下来再也没开火，连着几顿吃面包牛奶水果。\r\n这件事也让我心情一转，甚至担心积攒的reputation一朝尽毁，开始考虑是否主动提出取消10月的housesit安排，避免再有这种风险。host回来后和我说，很高兴房屋并没有被烧，你没出事，这也很重要。这件事也给你带来很大压力，如果你愿意，10月份还是希望继续过来帮忙看家。我立刻回复，只要你同意，我这边没有问题。差点搞砸但又被信任的感觉真是太好了，你看，我也没有真的搞砸。\r\n从7月17日离开西班牙，到现在快一个月了，我的这个夏天，美味，有趣，跌宕起伏又很神奇，重要的是，还很凉爽，尽管这两天荷兰也临时升温了。所以，如果因为抑郁焦虑折磨痛苦，如果一个人太孤单，如果找不到生活的意义失去兴趣，如果生活没有规律失去掌控，别放弃出门，试试游荡，去搭个鸡窝，做做木工，去花园除草，去帮人喂猫，完全不用动脑，还能及时得到反馈。如果有可能，最好来欧洲体验，来小鸡抑郁也能得到照顾，好好生活的地方。\r\n那些让你感觉碎掉的时刻，不是真的。\r\n为全球华人游荡者提供解决方案的平台：游荡者（www.youdangzhe.com）\r\n这世界的辽阔和美好，游荡者知道。使用过程中遇到问题，欢迎联系客服邮箱wanderservice2024@outlook.com.\r\n\r\n【放学以后文章&书籍&其它】\r\n\r\n解锁放学以后《创作者手册：从播客开始说起》：https://afdian.com/item/ffcd59481b9411ee882652540025c377\r\n\r\n解锁莫不谷《做一个“蓄意”的游荡者》口袋书：\r\n爱发电：https://afdian.com/item/62244492ae8611ee91185254001e7c00微信公众号：《放学以后After

Across from me, a reporter from the country’s most influential newspaper reading aloud past statements of mine, repeated out of context, crafted for a curated readership that often reflects its writer’s shifting moods and temperamental mindset.\r\n“She sounds like she changes her mind often,” I wanted to explain.\r\nBut fluid perspectives seemed a foreign concept to my midday guest. And the more I expanded, the less he appeared to grasp what it is I do. Or at least, what it is I seek to do.\r\nMostly, the legacy newsman was interested in one claim in particular: Did I actually believe Bill Clinton had a sexual relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell?\r\nIf so, did I understand the implications of printing such a claim? His question came cushioned by a hypothetical scenario meant to intimidate, but humored me instead: Bill Clinton could take me to court over such a salacious rumor. Did that concern me at all?\r\nNo.\r\nDid I believe this rumor?\r\nYes.\r\nWhy?\r\nAs someone who works in the business of gossip — which he kindly pointed out I do — it was a rumor with teeth; something I’d heard from all corners of my reach, believed to be true, and therefore worthy of printed theory. Imagining myself facing libel court waged by Bill Clinton, with discovery probing the backlog of his sex life, I found myself silently amused by such an absurd prospect.\r\nBesides, I didn’t birth the rumor. Three years ago I did a deep dive on it.\r\nRevealed: Bill Clinton’s Intimate Secret Dinner With Ghislaine Maxwell [ https://substack.com/redirect/49950246-ebea-42c7-9731-e65e4aba6b0f?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\nAll roads lead back to Douglas Band, Bill Clinton’s longtime confidant and founding partner of the multinational advisory firm Teneo, entrenched in “Clintonworld,” serving as Clinton’s body man during his presidency and later as one of the key architects of his post-presidential empire. His contribution to one explosive Vanity Fair article changed everything.\r\nIn Confessions of a Clintonworld Exile [ https://substack.com/redirect/08e3404b-d138-4d9f-be0b-4265aa64c77b?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], a year after Epstein’s death, Band broke the code of silence, exposing a web of secrets simmering beneath the surface of American political life. Central to his revelations: Bill Clinton’s rumored love affair with Ghislaine Maxwell, then modestly known as the daughter of a disgraced media mogul and Jeffrey Epstein’s closest associate.\r\nBand was blunt in print: “I tried for years to keep Epstein at a distance, but Clinton just couldn’t stay away.”\r\nHe also revealed Epstein was essentially a cover — an alibi for Clinton’s real reason for spending time in Epstein’s circle: Ghislaine Maxwell. According to unnamed sources, Clinton and Maxwell’s relationship was intimate for years. “Bill and Ghislaine were getting it on,” a close witness said. With Epstein as a convenient alibi, they could ferry Clinton around the world so he could be with Maxwell.\r\nTheir relationship extended beyond Caribbean retreats to New York City, where Clinton was repeatedly spotted visiting Maxwell’s $11 million townhouse on East 65th Street. The closeness between him, a former president, and her, a charming but increasingly elusive British socialite, drew occasional notice in New York social circles. Clinton and Maxwell were spotted dining together at the Madison Avenue Italian mainstay Nello, according to a 2002 New York magazine article, which described Maxwell as a “man-eater.” When Clinton went stag to a New York education charity gala in late 2001 —Hillary declined to attend — Maxwell was reportedly at his side.\r\nChelsea Clinton also grew very close to Ghislaine during this period. Maxwell’s vast network, her assets on generous loan, and her commitment to helping shape the early Clinton Foundation made her invaluable to the family. Because of what she provided for them, Band insisted Maxwell at a certain point was “more valuable” to the Clintons than Epstein: “You couldn’t hang out with her without being with him.”\r\nInternally, a mounting feud between Doug Band and Chelsea Clinton contributed to the impending fallout.\r\nInitially, Band wasn’t threatened by Chelsea’s new role. Separated by seven years, they “related to each other almost like half siblings.” When Chelsea was in her 20s, Band helped get her concert tickets and restaurant reservations. In 2010, Chelsea sent Band an effusive Christmas card. “I love you and am thankful beyond words for all you have done and do for my father,” she wrote.\r\nBut, as Vanity Fair noted, in every family, rivalries and jealousies tend to fester. Clintonworld sources revealed how Chelsea grew to resent Band. “Chelsea hated Doug because he was like a son to her father,” a Clinton friend said. Band took offense that Chelsea treated him at times like hired help.\r\nOver the next several months, their conflict unfolded with Bill Clinton caught in the middle. Chelsea heard from foundation officials that Band was “hustling” donors to become Teneo clients behind Bill’s back. In turn, Band heard that she had accused him of planting a Page Six item about troubles in her marriage, which he denied. Meanwhile, Band told foundation staff that Chelsea was vastly underqualified to take on a leadership role.\r\nBand, however, made it clear that Chelsea’s ongoing ties to Epstein were a central source of tension in his relationship with Bill. He saw it as a doomed course. Even in social context. \r\nWarning signs had been apparent for years. The infamous 2002 trip to Africa aboard Epstein’s private Boeing 727 — the so-called “Lolita Express” — marked a turning point. Band recalled Epstein “bragging the entire trip, like he invented the derivatives market,” an absurd display of ego that masked a far more dangerous intent. Though Band said he “had no idea about Epstein’s sex crimes back then,” he admitted getting enough bad vibes to advise Clinton to end the relationship.\r\nClinton ignored the warnings, continuing to socialize with Epstein and taking more than two dozen trips on Epstein’s jet. Flight logs show a 2003 visit by Clinton to Epstein’s private Caribbean island, Little St. James — a trip Band refused to join.\r\nIn 2006, Epstein donated $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Band lamented, “Clinton continued to socialize with Epstein and take his money.”\r\nHis remarks stunned the Clintons.\r\n“Bill must have done something very, very bad — worse than his usual self-dealing and pathological deceit — for Band, a surrogate son, to lash out like this,” the New York Post noted.\r\nVF added: “Those critics include the Clintons themselves, who offered a caustic assessment of Band when asked for comment. ‘No staffer has ever used their role to serve their interests as much as Doug Band,’ a Clinton family spokesperson told me. ‘For many years he was a valuable member of President Clinton’s team and supportive of Clinton Foundation programs. Until he wasn’t. He put the foundation at risk by leveraging a world-class philanthropy for his own financial gain. It’s as disappointing a story as it is a sad one and ultimately why Doug Band and the Clintons parted ways.’”\r\nChelsea Clinton, meanwhile, maintained a long friendship with Maxwell even after Epstein’s crimes became public. She invited Maxwell to her 2010 wedding at the Brooke Astor estate in Rhinebeck, New York, which Band deemed “a grab at high-society lifestyle.”\r\nMaxwell had failed to appear at a scheduled deposition, claiming she had to return to England to care for her dying mother. However, at the time of that trip, the elder Mrs. Maxwell was not gravely ill.\r\nAround the same time the deposition was scheduled, Maxwell was spotted in New York. She surfaced in a photo as a guest in the background at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding. Accompanied by Ted Waitt. \r\n“I knew in telling everyone to stop including Ghislaine that Chelsea and her father would be very angry,” he said. “It made it harder for them to justify being close to her.”\r\nDespite repeated denials from Clinton spokespeople, Band insisted these ties were real and consequential. Maxwell remained a constant presence at Clinton social events and Epstein-fueled trips.\r\nBand lamented, “Clinton continued to socialize with Epstein and take his money.” Flight logs and eyewitness reports painted a picture of sustained closeness.\r\n(It’s also worth noting that top Clinton advisor Mark Middleton, the man behind the liaison that connected Epstein to Clinton, died by suicide at the age of 59 on May 7, 2022, the Perry County Sheriff’s Office in Arkansas confirmed. Another rabbit hole to dig into another time.)\r\nAdding another crucial layer to the coverup which might explain why the affair remained mostly untraceable via Google search: the private emails stolen from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair, and published by WikiLeaks. These emails contain several references to Google and its parent company Alphabet’s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt.\r\nThe emails reveal a relationship with Schmidt dating back to at least 2008 and show that Google loaned its jet to members of Clinton’s campaign staff on several occasions. According to a February 2015 email to Podesta from Tina Flournoy, Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, Google planned to lend its company jet for a trip to Africa. Podesta wrote, “FYI. They are donating the Google plane for the Africa trip.”\r\nPost Epstein, Clinton remained frequently on flight with Maxwell. “Bill was always into Ghislaine,” is what everyone has always told me. Several sources relived stories of Bill at events they were part of, as friend to Ghislaine. One source remembers Bill being a “great time” at parties hosted at Maxwell’s townhouse in New York. The source described a scene: him taking tequila shots surrounded by fawning women, and Maxwell watching him like a hawk from an opposite corner of the room.\r\nA source I spoke to recounted Maxwell frequently flying to retrieve Bill during the Ted Waitt years. Familiar with the Waitt family when he was dating Ghislaine, they claimed she once flew Clinton to a particular destination for an operation “of some kind.” However, details were shaky as the source was the same age as one of Waitt’s teenage daughters— too young to care why the former president was on board, interpreting route to a family vacation.\r\nClinton, Maxwell, and Waitt remained close after Maxwell moved on from Epstein. Bill and Ted wrote each other letters Ghislaine sometimes kept on display. The Clintons remain close to the Waitt family today.\r\nShortly after Maxwell was sentenced, they continued to vacation with the Waitt family, even flying overseas to celebrate Ted Waitt’s 60th birthday.\r\nKnowing how it all unfolded, the fact that Clinton is now named a “prime suspect” in the files investigation feels straight out of a Shakespearean script. The Clintons used Maxwell for everything she could offer when it suited them, and the moment she became a liability, they dropped her. They distanced themselves, severing all ties to avoid her sins tainting their power, profit, and reputation.\r\nAs the story is shifting, the Epstein ordeal is dissolving any sense of ease for certain parties — the Clintons included — who have, until now, escaped scrutiny by association.\r\nGhislaine’s turn against Clinton, as ex lover, reads as retaliation, repurposed as leverage to secure a presidential pardon.\r\nIn her only prison interview, she dropped subtle hints, using praise as insinuation. Cues media collectively overlooked.\r\nSentiments I Picked Up on And Shared Line by Line in Bold Font:\r\n“Bill Clinton was a very special friend to me.”\r\n“We were close over a long period of time.”\r\n“I was close to both of the Clintons.”\r\n“I helped set up their foundations.”\r\n“He was one of the most interesting people I’ve ever met.”\r\n“I HOSTED PARTIES FOR THEM.”\r\nWhen Ghislaine added that her falling out with Bill was due to her support for Trump, again, everyone failed to recognize the foreshadowing.\r\nEven in skirted reference, the chemistry between them was instantly obvious to anyone reading between the lines. His name as frequent guest on the flight logs laid it out. There was no way Clinton was traveling regularly in the company of Epstein and Maxwell without engaging on an intimate level with a woman like her. Sources said she played this circle of men — Prince Andrew, Epstein, and Clinton — strategically. While Epstein and she had fallen out of a romantic relationship, he was still prone to jealousy over her flirtations with powerhouse players like Clinton, and she played it to her advantage.\r\nAnyone versed in Maxwell’s tastes would deduce that Clinton was an obvious conquest from the onset — as is overwhelmingly apparent in the photos documenting their introduction, where she looks like she wants to devour him. He was everything she was drawn to: immensely charismatic, articulate, intelligent, cultured, powerful, not to mention rich and hyper sexual, and said to appreciate the affection of older women because his ego preferred his intellect flattered.\r\nNick Tartaglione mentioned in one conversation Epstein noting Clinton’s penchant for older women. He said they made fun of him for seducing gray-haired ladies whenever they appeared.\r\nBased on trial insight, one might assume that Bill Clinton met his sexual match in Ghislaine Maxwell.\r\nAs of now, Bill Clinton is scheduled to testify before the committee on October 14, 2025, under subpoena.\r\nWhat we learn from here on out is bound to undress decades of lies and protective coverups the Clintons had come to count on, when Maxwell as ex flame and dutiful aid to their endeavors was where it served them best: silent, behind bars.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.1_Dk_Y5USyb0Qnj4V3ISk4nlli5g8e87X6TKqccuLB8?",

Pulling 80+ hour work weeks – including weekends – is becoming the norm across AI startups, and is unlikely to stop while AI is so hot.\r\nIndustry pulse. GPT-5 release feels like a flop, Big Tech no longer the dream job it was, Meta trials AI tools for interviews, OpenAI and Anthropic boost their values, Brex is back in the office, buyouts for Windsurf employees who aren’t “hardcore” enough, and more.\r\nFigma’s IPO: end of tech IPO winter? After going public, Figma is worth twice as much as Adobe offered to pay for it in 2023. Will the likes of Stripe, Databricks, and Discord, soon go public, too?\r\nWill “spec-driven-development” + AI agents succeed or flop? AWS launched its own VS Fork called Kiro. The idea is clever execution, done well, yet I sense many parallels to GitHub Workspaces, which never really took off.\r\n1. New trend: extreme hours at AI startups\r\n“996” stands for “from 9am to 9pm, 6 days a week”, and is a common work pattern at Chinese tech companies, but has long been rejected in the US. It is even outlawed in Europe because excessive hours tend to lead to burnout and other health issues, longer term.\r\nDespite that, more AI startups are adopting something similar to the 996 work pattern, including Cognition, which expects staff to put in 80+ hours per week. Indeed, the CEO, Scott Wu, was unapologetic about the company’s hardcore culture in a post he shared [ https://substack.com/redirect/0567be44-6bc0-4263-9ab4-bb1273e8eb20?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]:\r\n“People have asked about our culture and recent employee communications. Cognition has an extreme performance culture, and we’re upfront about this in hiring so there are no surprises later.\r\nWe routinely are at the office through the weekend and do some of our best work late into the night. Many of us literally live where we work.\r\nWe know that people who joined Windsurf didn’t expect to join Cognition and while we’re proud of how we work, we understand it’s not for everyone”.\r\nThere are several other cases of AI startups mandating grueling hours for workers:\r\nLovable: job descriptions by the company detail [ https://substack.com/redirect/df1656a1-c519-445b-8291-48192b277081?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] “Long hours, high pace. Candidates must thrive under high urgency, with AGI timelines approaching.”\r\nReplit: CEO, Amjad Masad, posted photos [ https://substack.com/redirect/34004504-4fc4-4bfd-bea8-c92638d43023?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] of the whole team grinding in the office at midnight, preparing to ship something big.\r\nxAI: Zeeshan Pate, an engineer at Elon Musk’s AI startup, shared [ https://substack.com/redirect/10a5455b-11d4-4df3-ac53-05891729db08?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] that the team was “grinding in the office day and night”.\r\nCodeRabbit: just today, the team was still shipping [ https://substack.com/redirect/cb78f2eb-eba0-4375-8264-7b28f8653dee?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] at 2:30am in the San Francisco headquarters\r\nIcon (ad maker): the founder and CEO shared [ https://substack.com/redirect/d14a260f-b2d9-4301-8c65-8746913ad0c0?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] that the business “only hires [the] top 0.01% engineers with no life”, and expects them to work all week: “why do 6 [days of work] when you can do 7”.\r\nGoogle’s AI unit: Google cofounder Sergey Brin told [ https://substack.com/redirect/ed799e88-d56a-4ef2-92ba-c7c61ee25cea?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] staff in the tech giant’s AI unit: “60 hours a week is the sweet spot of productivity”.\r\nThese extreme hours are justified by a sprint to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in just a matter of months. That’s because plenty of AI professionals believe that when this point is reached, it will be “game over” for most companies in the segment, with a new, solidified, status quo in place, and AGI being able to improve itself with more resources. From then on, companies with AGI will dominate the industry. This is the incentive for using every means possible (including employees’ labor) to get to AGI – and quickly! Personally, I don’t buy this simplistic prediction about AGI and what might happen when or if it’s reached, but it is the driving force behind the thinking of many founders with commercial pressures.\r\nIt’s nearly three years since ChatGPT was released, and there are still no signs of AGI, even though LLMs continuously improve. But what about the exhausting work patterns that are meant to be in place for a few months; could they stay in place for years, and become standard?\r\nAsking or demanding staff to put in very long hours is a recipe for making the pace of work slow down, and for individuals to burn out. We live in an economic system in which companies try to “extract” as much as possible from employees across all industries, so why don’t employers in other sectors also make staff work 80-hour weeks?\r\nIn many countries, regulations mandating sensible working conditions are one reason, and unions advocate for this. Another is that the downside of long working hours soon becomes visible:\r\nStaff take more time off for sickness\r\nProductivity drops\r\nMore employees quit for places with shorter working weeks\r\nPlus, mandating long working hours automatically excludes many strong potential candidates who…\r\nhave family duties outside of working hours\r\nlive further from the office, and for whom the commute would be too long\r\nprioritize personal, non-work, activities outside of core hours\r\nOf course, if you hire young professionals, burnout won’t occur so fast – and some people can work for years like this. Plus, if they don’t have families or a busy social life, they may be comfortable with working what looks like “crazy” hours.\r\nAnother powerful incentive for an AI startup to create a long-hours culture: the promise of generational wealth. Consider these two questions:\r\nWould you work 6 days a week at a startup, and pull 80+ hours per week indefinitely, for less than you’d earn at a company with a 40-hour work week?\r\nWould you work 6 days a week and put in 80+ hour weeks for 1-3 years, then walk away with $10M in compensation?\r\nThe answer to #1 is likely “no”, but the answer to #2 is “obviously yes” for most people! And the incredible growth in the AI industry means that #2 seems achievable to many. Take Windsurf: just 10 months after launching the Windsurf IDE, 40 employees from the team were acquired by Google. The founders likely made hundreds of millions, and some engineers may have made $10M+ in compensation! That’s not bad for a few years’ work!\r\nNow, put yourself in the shoes of founders who are set to make not $10M, but a multiple of that. For them, it was absolutely worth putting in the long hours and pushing their team to do the same.\r\nBased on that, we can expect founders to keep pushing staff to spend every waking moment at work, or thinking about work.\r\nWhile there's the promise of making it big with AI startups, these working hours will likely stay. Within AI startups, founders face pressure to ship fast or be out-executed by rivals. Speed is essential to win in AI, time-to-market is essential, and the most obvious way to attempt to get things done faster is to push people to work more.\r\nFor the importance of time to market: just look at startups like Magic.dev. A year ago, it raised $515M in funding and claimed [ https://substack.com/redirect/d4ad1c9e-714d-45f4-911f-c4b58c3e1425?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] it could support 100M token context windows, at a time when most models could not even support 100K. That meant Magic’s model would be a 1,000x improvement on mainstream LLMs! However, a year later and Google’s Gemini already supports [ https://substack.com/redirect/f43a3160-d901-4fa4-b7ac-f34546244f40?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] 2M tokens, and Claude added [ https://substack.com/redirect/9f1d80a3-b48e-4f5d-bcc3-91bd922b0f7b?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] support for 1M tokens. So Magic’s lead is cut to 50-100x – which is still considerable, but much reduced.\r\nAt the same time, there have not been updates from Magic, and this 100M context window model is not publicly available for use. If the company does not ship a public-facing product soon, they could see mainstream LLMs catch up in context window length, and thereby lose most of their potential customer base in the dev market.\r\nStill, right now there’s a massive business opportunity to make lots of money with AI products, and for early employees to create generational wealth via generous equity – if their startup executes well, and is later acquired for a huge sum.\r\nBut long hours alone don’t guarantee success, and there are signs of this. Cognition is proud of its “extreme performance culture”, but its office culture hasn’t quite led to business success: Devin was one of the least-referenced AI tools in The Pragmatic Engineer 2025 survey [ https://substack.com/redirect/8f15067b-b6fe-4f75-baed-b94a6508599f?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].\r\nAnother sign that grueling hours don’t automatically generate success is the ad maker, Icon. Despite demanding 7-day working weeks from staff, the company seems to be pivoting to become just another advertising agency [ https://substack.com/redirect/894943a6-3fe3-4266-981e-b710001943e8?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], offering to create unlimited versions of ads for $1,000/month. Ad agencies are pretty good lifestyle businesses, but rarely the kind of high-growth ventures valued in the billions!\r\nI expect that things will eventually return to normal in a few years' time, when every tech company will also be an “AI company” and it will be business as usual. But for now, the fear of missing out (FOMO) is so strong across the industry that very long workweeks look set to spread.\r\nEveryone’s situation is different, so figure out if you want or need to work extreme hours. But there will be more of a push from AI startups to weed out applicants who are resistant to very long work weeks. Accepting such a position can be an amazing career boost; yes, long hours have many downsides, but you “gel” better with colleagues, and relationships forged under pressure can last decades. Of course, all the stress can also lead to burnout and health issues.\r\nIn the end, just know that this trend is real and likely to stick around. If your workplace employs a more “normal” work pattern, it’s worth knowing that this is not necessarily something you can take for granted across tech!\r\n2.

Until now, however, it hasn’t always been possible to upgrade to a paid subscription directly in the app.\r\nThat’s changing. Apple now allows Substack to include external links for paid subscriptions in the iOS app in the U.S., while also requiring that all publications offer in-app purchase (IAP) as an option.\r\nFor users in the U.S., this is what the subscribe screen in the app now looks like:\r\nMore than 30,000 Substack publications already have IAP enabled, and early tests suggest that the additional options help bring in more paid subscribers.\r\nHunter Harris  has seen a jump in paid sign-ups since her IAP launched: \r\n“With the Substack iOS app, subscribing to Hung Up  now happens in just a few taps—without leaving the app. Whether readers pay via the web link or Apple’s in-app purchase, it’s been a huge boost for growth by making it easier than ever for devoted readers to become paid subscribers in seconds.”\r\nAbout Apple’s fees\r\nSubscriptions from outside the app and via the app’s external link flow are billed as before. For IAP subscriptions, Apple collects a percentage of the payment [ https://substack.com/redirect/53d68733-cf42-4d91-a798-504272d07a5d?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]. To protect your earnings, Substack automatically sets your iOS app price higher so you take home approximately the same amount as a web-based subscription. By default this adjustment is on, but you can turn it off in your settings if you prefer. We’ve also built migration tools so you can export those subscriber relationships, if needed.\r\nWhat’s next\r\nIn-app purchase is now fully enabled for all paid publications in the Substack iOS app, and the improved subscribe flows are already live in the app. No action is required unless you want to adjust prices via your publication settings.\r\nFor more details, check out the FAQ [ https://substack.com/redirect/2ad65253-401c-41f3-8299-d2fc39756c2d?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].

We reported some results in Part 1 of this mini series [ https://substack.com/redirect/9a70b2c2-653b-41d1-86bb-f48ab15d8302?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], and today, we look into more metrics contained in the circa 3,000 responses. A big thanks to everyone who took the time to fill out the survey.\r\nWe cover:\r\nMost-mentioned tools. JIRA, VS Code, and AWS lead the pack.\r\nProject management. Linear is becoming a challenger to JIRA and is especially popular at smaller companies.\r\nCommunication and collaboration. Slack is the most frequently-used tool for chat, for video calling it’s MS Teams, Confluence for documents, Miro for whiteboarding, and Figma for design tasks.\r\nDatabases and data stores. PostgreSQL is the leading choice for databases, and there’s a very long tail of database solutions which professionals choose.\r\nBackend infrastructure. Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform are used everywhere, alongside many managed AWS services.\r\nForks of popular open-source projects. OpenSearch seems to be eating into Elasticsearch’s market share, while Valkey and OpenTofu seem not to have persuaded many developers to drop Redis and Terraform.\r\nAs a reminder, in the first of these articles on The Pragmatic Engineer 2025 survey [ https://substack.com/redirect/9a70b2c2-653b-41d1-86bb-f48ab15d8302?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], we covered:\r\nDemographics\r\nAI tools\r\nMost used, most-loved programming languages\r\nMost hated (and loved) tools\r\nIDEs and terminals\r\nVersion control and CI/CD\r\nCloud providers, IaaS, and PaaS\r\nThe bottom of this article could be cut off in some email clients. Read the full article uninterrupted, online. [ https://substack.com/redirect/6fcc6616-409e-431a-8baf-92c32ec2a81c?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\n1. Most-mentioned tools\r\nBelow is a summary of the most-mentioned tools from around 3,000 survey respondents. Everyone mentioned several tools, and this chart lists those cited by at least 10% of respondents (300):\r\nThe biggest surprises for me:\r\nJIRA is the most used tool. More software engineers work with JIRA than with VS Code or AWS – which is a surprise! It’s known that JIRA is widely used across tech companies, and the survey replies reveal just how much.\r\nFigma mentioned more than Kubernetes or Cursor. Figma is a tool designers use for creating user interfaces which are easy to share with developers for collaboration. Figma recently went public, valued at $34B at the time of publication. It’s one of the most-used tools by software engineers, and our survey suggests why the company is so valuable.\r\nOther observations on the most-used tools:\r\nMicrosoft is dominant across the tooling which developers use. VS Code (IDE), GitHub (version control), GitHub Copilot (AI coding) and GitHub Actions (CI/CD) are some of the most-used tools. Of the 15 most common tools, 4 are owned and operated by Microsoft.\r\nGrafana, Datadog, and Sentry are popular with developers. Grafana (visualizing observability data), Datadog (observability), and Sentry (monitoring and performance analysis), are used by 15-25% of respondents – more than the likes of Notion and Google Workspace. Datadog is publicly traded and valued at $44B, Grafana is private and was last valued at $6B, while Sentry is valued at $3B. Given Grafana and Sentry seem to be equally popular with developers, it’s worth asking if they are actually undervalued compared to Datadog, or whether Datadog simply monetizes its software better.\r\n2. Project management\r\nPart 1 of the survey [ https://substack.com/redirect/9a70b2c2-653b-41d1-86bb-f48ab15d8302?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] results found that JIRA is the “most disliked tool” among developers, based on the number of negative mentions subtracted by the number of positive mentions. This suggests that many engineers using JIRA don’t want to use it but have no choice, which makes sense because it’s often engineering leaders, product folks, or the CEO who select project management software. Smaller competitor Linear is the 4th most-loved tool.

Almost three times as many people use Azure DevOps as use GitHub Issues, despite GitHub having a much larger overall market share. Granted, Azure DevOps supports CI/CD as well as project management, but it’s still noteworthy how popular the tool is.\r\nLooking closer, GitHub Issues seems to be popular at very small teams (50 or smaller) and Azure DevOps is a lot more used at larger companies:\r\nBoth Azure DevOps and GitHub are built by Microsoft, and the popularity of Azure DevOps makes me wonder if Microsoft may one day try to push Azure DevOps on GitHub users more, or integrate GitHub Issues to serve as an onboarding to Azure DevOps. Both might make business sense.\r\nLinear is used far more by devs than its higher-valued publicly traded competitors. What I find curious is that Linear is valued [ https://substack.com/redirect/a7fefc5d-5c09-42af-bc81-c3ef7e870d76?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] at a comparatively modest $1.25B, while having far more developers using its project management solution than who use publicly traded competitors Asana (market cap $3.25B), and Monday.com ($9B.) This suggests Asana and Monday.com are more popular outside of software engineering.\r\nIf we take just JIRA and Linear, the pair account for close to 75% of tooling usage in this survey:\r\nJIRA dominates at large companies, while Linear is surging at smaller ones this year. Let’s see how often JIRA and Linear are mentioned, by company size:\r\nLinear is almost as popular at “tiny” companies (50 or fewer employees) as JIRA. At the same time, at workplaces with 1,000+ people, Linear is close to nonexistent. In the survey, developers at larger companies said they wish they could use Linear instead of JIRA. Here’s what two developers at larger companies think:\r\n“Jira is just a hostile tool towards actually delivering stuff, antithetical to how great software should be IMO. I’d prefer to use Linear.”\r\n“I dislike how JIRA tool is incredibly non-performant given what it does, and how it can get so bloated—and how fixing that takes a ton of tool-specific knowledge, admin privileges, and perpetual maintenance. I understand that task management software is hard to get right (I hate Asana even more), and if my company would allow it, I'd love to try Linear (or even just use Google Sheets more)”\r\nOne surprising finding is that even the smallest companies are still just about more likely to use JIRA than any other tool. It has managed to become synonymous with project management, and the default choice for many companies of all sizes.\r\n3. Communication and collaboration\r\nHere are the chat, video, document editing, and other communication-related tools which developers frequently use.\r\nChat\r\nSlack dominates chat tools, with Microsoft Teams a distant second:\r\nOther tools:\r\nDiscord [ https://substack.com/redirect/8eb173bf-a8f1-4ea5-a4ec-975fa1f26128?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: a popular chat platform originally built for gamers. Despite not being enterprise-ready, it’s still the third most-popular tool in this category. Discord is popular as a community support channel, with open source projects and in frontend communities. Our sense is that Discord is most used in these settings, and not for inter-company communication.\r\nGoogle Chat [ https://substack.com/redirect/ddd6baed-264c-4594-8e3b-db26dd5ceeaa?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Google’s chat product.

MS Teams is most popular:\r\nComparison in this category is a little tricky because MS Teams is a chat and video calling tool, while Google Meet and Zoom are solely for video calls. Other mentions include Cisco’s Webex [ https://substack.com/redirect/b90ca04a-3767-446e-89a0-ad9447008d92?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], Tuple [ https://substack.com/redirect/7dd40f24-92bb-45ec-b51b-ad002d441e26?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (a remote pair programming tool), and Slack Huddle [ https://substack.com/redirect/9e825eff-2dc4-4248-bbd2-d76a1b1ac175?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (multi-person screen sharing, a feature inside Slack)\r\nIt’s surprising that Google Meet is more mentioned than Zoom because Zoom’s bread-and-butter is video calling, whereas Google Meet is a free Google Workspace add-on. Could we be seeing the search giant and Microsoft slowly but surely capturing Zoom’s market share – at least within tech companies?\r\nDocs\r\nWhat developers use for writing documents:\r\nMost-mentioned tools:\r\nConfluence [ https://substack.com/redirect/1c3a8f10-9c13-4ea5-9757-7aea6846ea11?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Atlassian’s wiki solution which integrates nicely with JIRA\r\nNotion [ https://substack.com/redirect/1c3a8f10-9c13-4ea5-9757-7aea6846ea11?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: a popular note taking and knowledge-sharing suite\r\nGoogle Workspace [ https://substack.com/redirect/0df5cfb7-4dc6-42c5-bb5f-7d51cfeed0f2?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Google’s office suite\r\nSharePoint [ https://substack.com/redirect/a905806f-3621-4f7d-9df8-b379eb7e891a?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Microsoft’s wiki alternative\r\nMicrosoft 365 [ https://substack.com/redirect/a699c2d8-1c88-4d22-8f9c-fb63e6ce6825?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Microsoft’s office package\r\nConfluence being so popular surprised me, not least because it’s the third most-disliked tool in our survey – although it’s also the most popular wiki and documentation tool among all companies. Seamless integration with JIRA – and being bundled as part of the Atlassian suite – seems more decisive in businesses adopting Confluence than developers’ complaints about it are.\r\nThe long tail of tools below is indeed lengthy, and each one was mentioned by under 1% of respondents (30 mentions)\r\nQuip [ https://substack.com/redirect/1730ddfb-4eb0-4e30-bb73-b2b62c2eb48c?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: document editing by Salesforce, tailored for sales teams\r\nObsidian [ https://substack.com/redirect/5e5ce568-ddbc-483b-a268-2d62d62a4a6c?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: note-taking tool intended for single-user usage\r\nAirtable [ https://substack.com/redirect/3f73f688-da11-4b45-9eb3-34a404ffd2f0?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: formerly an enterprise Google Sheets alternative, now transformed into a vibe coding app builder\r\nZoho [ https://substack.com/redirect/4ac6bcad-72b8-47bd-84d3-84d60cf167fd?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: an office suite, as well as a customer relationship management (CRM) and email tool.\r\nSlite [ https://substack.com/redirect/19f12b0f-1f9d-4510-a763-c67c4fbccdbe?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: a knowledge base solution\r\nMediaWiki [ https://substack.com/redirect/c4b33a17-c264-4600-a3a0-a18a0f47de24?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: an open source wiki platform\r\nMS Loop [ https://substack.com/redirect/a8fc62cd-64e2-4fb6-802e-d9b181000b7d?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Microsoft’s “Notion clone.” So little usage of this suggests that the popularity of Notion has less to do with how it looks (which Loop replicated), and more to do with how Notion works.\r\nDropbox Pape [ https://substack.com/redirect/9c34a727-b063-477d-898f-a2ca6b6a8ac9?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]r: the office suite by Dropbox\r\nEvernote [ https://substack.com/redirect/74acfcaf-08f3-4b14-b9e6-159256577efd?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: a note-taking tool, now owned by Bending Spoons.

One in three respondents use PostgreSQL – and no other database technology comes close in popularity. PostgreSQL is open source, with a large number of extensions that can add functionality – from support for full text search [ https://substack.com/redirect/69df182f-07a1-4386-b856-b5e314f5b933?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], to support for hypothetical indexes [ https://substack.com/redirect/bac9b924-9eb5-4d5f-b121-e7400874c802?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], you’ll probably find extensions that solve your problems.

This is likely because relational databases like PostgreSQL added vector support which works well enough – and most LLM applications can just store embeddings as vectors in these relational databases, or by using extensions like the Pgvector extension [ https://substack.com/redirect/fcb84fd2-da6f-48ab-877f-1ffa3c0ddbb1?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] for Postgres, or the Atlas Vector Search addon [ https://substack.com/redirect/66c8fb2b-ba9c-47b6-9453-6ed3882673f9?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] for MongoDB.

We know AWS is the leading cloud provider, but it was still unexpected to see so many AWS services mentioned by hundreds of respondents each, such as ECS, EKS, EC2, and Fargate.

Maybe AWS offering more than 240 services (and growing) reflects this demand?\r\nContainerization is widespread, and Kubernetes is the most common approach to managing containers.

How are forks of popular open source infra projects doing?\r\nIn recent years, several open source projects have changed their licenses to be more restrictive, including Elasticsearch, Redis, and Terraform. In each case, new forks were then created:\r\nOpenSearch: created in response to Elasticsearch making its license restrictive in 2021. Elasticsearch went back to open source in 2024 [ https://substack.com/redirect/61d50f8f-ab7c-49b1-9f78-3e7c8bbb94d3?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], and we analyzed this reversal in detail.

A year later, Redis returned to being open source [ https://substack.com/redirect/02f008b9-bd57-4a2b-97a1-f2f986dde2c0?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].\r\nOpenTofu: created in response to Terraform moving to a more restrictive Business Source License (BUSL) in 2023 [ https://substack.com/redirect/ab6856b5-5540-491e-b502-d9960aaaa634?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]. We analyzed this in more detail. [ https://substack.com/redirect/ab6856b5-5540-491e-b502-d9960aaaa634?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\nHere are the market shares of forks in this survey, based on numbers of mentions:\r\nOpen source forks seem to get little traction, except for Elasticsearch. The popularity of OpenSearch is likely to do with AWS: in 2021, Elasticsearch changed its license to no longer allow AWS to offer a managed Elasticsearch service without paying Elastic a licensing fee. In response, AWS started to offer a managed OpenSearch service and launched the Amazon OpenSearch Engine [ https://substack.com/redirect/919861d9-c99e-4792-9008-0d4bd647dcb4?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], which integrates nicely with AWS services like S3, Lambda and Kinesis.\r\nIn 2024, Elasticsearch went back to being open source, but AWS still does not offer a managed Elasticsearch service, given Amazon OpenSearch Engine works just as well. All things being equal for developers on AWS infrastructure, going with OpenSearch is not very different from using Elasticsearch – and a lot simpler in that case.\r\nI wonder if the growing popularity of OpenSearch might be another reason why Elasticsearch changed back its license in 2024 to open source?\r\nThe survey also suggests Terraform has been almost unaffected by the open source OpenTofu. It continues to be licensed as Business Source License (BUSL), but in this case, the open source fork, OpenTofu, is not getting much traction.\r\nTo me, the contrast between OpenSearch’s wide adoption traction and OpenTofu’s lack of traction illustrates how important the identity of a company promoting an open source fork is. AWS committing to OpenSearch made a dent in Elasticsearch’s usage, whereas OpenTofu has no platform with a massive distribution behind it. The largest OpenTofu sponsors are Harness [ https://substack.com/redirect/6cc0615e-c5d5-45d0-8e77-ce7975583619?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (software delivery platform), Spacelift [ https://substack.com/redirect/0cdef744-9c64-43b1-9108-24e1462969be?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (IaaC orchestration engine), and env0 [ https://substack.com/redirect/418de071-dc5c-481d-8735-e25ed15b5000?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (automating infrastructure at scale). All are promising infrastructure startups, but none has the size of customer base that AWS does.\r\nTakeaways\r\nHere are my top observations about this second part of The Pragmatic Engineer 2025 survey:\r\nProject management is part of our job, as devs. Project management tools are as frequently mentioned as IDEs. That’s because creating and updating tickets is as much a part of an engineer’s job as writing code is. With AI tools spreading which promise to draft pull requests from well-written tickets, the expectation for us devs to document our tasks will likely only increase.\r\nIt’s hard to go wrong choosing PostgreSQL as a database. There are many specialized databases that offer better scalability than Postgres, yet it remains the leading choice across the industry. The pragmatic approach to databases might not be asking “which database should we use?” but rather: “what might stop us from using Postgres?”\r\nIt could be sensible to understand Kubernetes better, even if you don’t work with it. A quarter of respondents mention Kubernetes as part of their stack. If your workplace decides to be more hands-on with your infrastructure, the most obvious tool for this will be Kubernetes. We previously covered Kubernetes in the podcast episode How Kubernetes is built [ https://substack.com/redirect/bfb3a9df-1406-4db4-81e3-72eabb744904?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] – it could be a good starting point for this container orchestrating technology.\r\nDoes forking have less impact on formerly open source projects than expected? The popularity of Redis and Terraform seems to not have changed since they stopped being open source, despite permissive forks being available. Elasticsearch is the counterpoint to this, with OpenSearch now used by around 25% of developers, compared to Elasticsearch. In that case, the caveat is Amazon.\r\nI hope this article – along with Part 1 [ https://substack.com/redirect/9a70b2c2-653b-41d1-86bb-f48ab15d8302?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] of this dive into the results of our latest survey of the state of dev tooling in 2025 – is interesting. In a future issue, we’ll wrap up the findings of this detailed look into the tech stacks of software engineers by focusing on frontend, mobile, and developer platform tools.

The Hopper vs Blackwell comparisons are not as simple as Nvidia would have you believe.\r\n\r\nIn this report, we will start by present the results of benchmark runs across over 2,000 H100 GPUs, analyzing data on model flops utilization (MFU), total cost of ownership (TCO) and cost per training 1M tokens. We will also discuss energy use, examining the energy in utility Joules consumed for each token trained and compare it to the average US household annual energy usage, reframing power efficiency in societal context. We will also show the results of this analysis when scaling the GPU cluster from 128 H100s to 2048 H100s and across different versions of Nvidia software.\r\n\r\nLater in this report, we will also analyze GB200 NVL72 benchmark results across Llama4 400B MoE and DeepSeek 670B MoE and compare this data to our earlier results from the H100. We will discuss whether the GB200 NVL72 performance per $ advantages survives once reliability issues are factored in.\r\n\r\nDowntime from poor reliability and lost engineering time is one of the main factors that we will capture in our perf per TCO calculations. Currently there are no large-scale training runs done yet on GB200 NVL72 as software continues to mature and reliability challenges are worked through. This means that Nvidia’s H100 and H200 as well as Google TPUs remain the only GPUs that are today being successfully used to complete frontier-scale training. As it stands today, even the most advanced operators at frontier labs and CSPs are not yet able to carry out mega training runs on the GB200 NVL72.\r\n\r\nWith that said, every new architecture naturally requires time for the ecosystem to ramp software to effectively utilize the architecture. The GB200 NVL72 ramp is slightly slower than prior generations, but not by much, and we are confident that before the end of the year, GB200 NVL72 software would have improved considerably. Combined with frontier models architecture being codesigned with the larger scale up world size in mind, we expect that there will be significant efficiency gains from using the GB200 NVL72 by the end of the year.\r\n\r\nOn the reliability front, there will continue to be significant challenges that Nvidia must work even closer with its partners to rapidly solve, but we think the ecosystem will quickly rally its resources towards tackling these reliability challenges.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nSemiAnalysis Is Hiring\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a new grad engineer to join our engineering team. This is an unique opportunity to work on an high-visibility special projects with support from many industry leaders and CEOs. If you’re passionate about performance engineering, system reliability, and want to work at the intersection of hardware and software, this is a rare chance to make industry wide impact.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll work on:\r\n\r\n* Building and running large-scale benchmarks across multiple vendors (AMD, NVIDIA, TPU, Trainium, etc.\r\n* Designing reproducible CI/CD pipelines to automate benchmarking workflows\r\n* Ensuring reliability and scalability of systems used by industry partners\r\n\r\nWhat we’re looking for:\r\n\r\n* Strong skills in Python\r\n* Background in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) or systems-level problem solving\r\n* Experience with CI/CD pipelines and modern DevOps practices\r\n* Curiosity about GPUs, TPUs, Trainium, multicloud, and performance benchmarking ( https://app.dover.com/apply/SemiAnalysis/2a9c8da5-6d59-4ac8-8302-3877345dbce1/?rs=76643084 )\r\n\r\nLink to apply: https://app.dover.com/apply/SemiAnalysis/2a9c8da5-6d59-4ac8-8302-3877345dbce1\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nBenchmarking and Analysis Methodology\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor our benchmarking and analysis, we rely on Nvidia’s DGXC Benchmarking Team’s new DGX Cloud Benchmarking Scripts executed on NVIDIA’s internal H100 EOS cluster, configured with 8×400 Gbit/s InfiniBand networking. These results serve as the official reference numbers against which Neocloud environments can be compared when defining service-level agreements (SLAs) between Neoclouds and their customers.\r\n\r\nClouds can also submit benchmarks to NVIDIA and if they are able to meet these EOS reference numbers then they can earn the NVIDIA Exemplar Cloud designation. Our upcoming ClusterMAXv2 will heavily weight providers’ Exemplar Clouds status when evaluating service quality as this status is a stamp of approval that a provider can deliver reference performance numbers across many workloads for large scale GPU deployments.\r\n\r\nThe aforementioned benchmarks are conducted using NeMo Megatron-LM, but given that many end users of GPUs do not exclusively rely on NeMo Megatron-LM, the DGXC benchmarking team has plans to extend coverage to native Torch DTensor frameworks such as TorchTitan.\r\n\r\nWe would like to thank the Nvidia DGCX benchmarking team for creating these sets of benchmarks and providing reference numbers to help lift up the GPU Cloud industry!\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nH100 and GB200 NVL72 Capex, Opex, Total Cost of Ownership Analysis\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe price of an H100 server has dropped somewhat in the past 18 months to around $190k per server. Including storage, networking and other items, the total upfront capital cost per server comes up to $250k for a typical hyperscaler.\r\n\r\nTurning to the GB200 NVL72, the rack scale server alone costs $3.1M for a typical hyperscaler. Including networking, storage and other items, all in cost comes up to about $3.9M per rack.\r\n\r\nWhen comparing across all three buyer types, from Hyperscalers to Neocloud Giants to Emerging Neoclouds, the GB200 NVL72’s all-in capital cost per GPU comes to about 1.6x to 1.7x the all-in capital cost per GPU of the H100.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis ( https://semianalysis.com/ai-cloud-tco-model/ )\r\n\r\nComparing the two systems’ operating cost of ownership, we find that the Opex per GPU for the GB200 NVL72 is not that much higher than that of the H100. The cost difference comes from the fact the GB200 NVL72 has a higher all-in power consumption per GPU than the H100. This is primarily driven by the fact that the GB200 chip consumes 1200W per chip vs 700W for the H100.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis ( https://semianalysis.com/ai-cloud-tco-model/ )\r\n\r\nWhen factoring in both capex and opex in order to arrive at the total cost of ownership (TCO), we see that TCO for the GB200 NVL72 is about 1.6x higher than TCO for the H100. This means that the GB200 NVL72 needs to be at least 1.6x faster than the H100 in order to have an performance per TCO advantage when compared to the H100.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis ( https://semianalysis.com/ai-cloud-tco-model/ )\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\nThree things Nvidia could do better for the ML community\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBefore we deep dive into the benchmarks and results, we will present three key suggestions to Nvidia.\r\n\r\nFirst, we recommend that Nvidia expand their benchmarking efforts and increase transparency even more. In order for Nvidia to continuously raise the bar across the entire GPU cloud industry, it needs to benchmark across both its Hyperscaler partners and Nvidia Cloud Partners (NCPs) and make the data publicly available. With this, anyone in the ML community can factor the benchmarking data into their decision making process before signing contracts worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nAs an example, in the first release of our ClusterMAX rating system, we pointed out that GCP’s older a3-mega H100 delivered 10% worse than average MFU for O(Llama 70B) size training and 15-20% worse than average for MFU of O(8x7B) mixture of experts spare models ( https://semianalysis.com/2025/03/26/the-gpu-cloud-clustermax-rating-system-how-to-rent-gpus/#google-cloud ). Thus, end users should be paying 10-20% lower than average rental cost to GCP in order to achieve the same performance per dollar as the market average. Having a publicly available set of benchmark results across the Hyperscaler and NCP providers will dramatically increase the ease of negotiating fair contract prices and speed up decision making. This can save considerable time and money on both sides by obviating the need for extensive, costly and time-consuming proof of concept runs.\r\n\r\nOur second recommendation to Nvidia is that they expand their benchmarking focus beyond NeMo-MegatronLM as many users prefer to use Native PyTorch with FSDP2 and DTensor instead of NeMo-MegatronLM. One advantage of using NeMo-MegatronLM is that at any given time, there are many performance features in NeMo-MegatronLM that aren’t yet available in native PyTorch. It is reasonable for the latest features to be rolled out to NeMo-Megatron first, but all of these features should be upstreamed to native PyTorch after a month’s time at most. To this end, more Nvidia engineers should be allocated towards PyTorch core development instead of being tasked with adding more features to NeMo. Nvidia expanding benchmarking focus should include runs employing PyTorch will dovetail perfectly with this initiative as well.\r\n\r\nInstead of having engineers optimize NeMo, they should be optimizing TorchTitan. The new NeMo AutoModel ( https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Automodel/ ) library is a step in the right direction it as supports native PyTorch FSDP2 backend in addition to Megatron-LM, noticeability missing is native PyTorch 3D+ Parallelism with DTensor and a lot of pretraining features is absent and most of the features is for finetuning.\r\n\r\nOur third recommendation is that Nvidia continue to accelerate development of diagnostics and debugging tools for GB200 NVL72 backplane. Unfortunately, even after an extensive burn-in process, the NVLink copper backplane still is not that reliable. Operators of the GB200 NVL72 also lament that this problem is compounded by the fact that the tools used to diagnose and debug back-plane related errors are behind and sub-optimal. Nvidia can also improve the situation by insisting on even stricter acceptance tests across their ODM/OEM partners before handing GB200 NVL72 racks over to their customers.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nGPT-3 175B Token/s/GPU, Training Performance and Power. Cost Improvements from January 2024 to December 2024\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn the table below, we present the results of our benchmark runs in which we train GPT-3 175B on a 128 H100 cluster at different points in time. We chose to display results across different NeMo-Megatron LM Versions starting from January 2024 and ending in December 2024, representing one year and two years respectively from the start of H100 mass deployment.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark setup uses 128 H100s with 4 data replicas. Each data replica consists of 32 GPUs parallelized with each layer tensor parallelized using the NVLink domain across 4 GPUs (i.e. TP=4) and then pipelined. One might think that it would be best to do TP=8 to match the entire NVLink domain world size of 8 GPUs for the H100, but for GPT-3 175B model, it is better to use TP=4 as this will have a higher arithmetic intensity.\r\n\r\nTo elaborate, GPT3 175B’s hidden dimension is 12,288, which means if one were to use TP=8, the result will be a small K reduction dim of 1,536. By comparison, when using TP=4, the hidden reduction dim will instead be 3,072.\r\n\r\nThe sequence length of the benchmark follows the original GPT-3 paper setup ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165 ) and uses 2,048 seq length as well as a global batch size of 256 samples. This means the model will see 500k (Global Batch Size * Seq Len) tokens before each optimizer step.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at BF16 model flops utilization (MFU), we see a considerable improvement from 34% MFU to 54% MFU over the course of 12 months, amounting to a 57% improvement in training throughput solely from software improvements across the CUDA stack. This improvement results from NVIDIA CuDNN/CuBLAS engineers writing more optimized fused wgmma kernels, NCCL engineers writing more optimized collectives that use fewer SMs for communication among other improvements. At the end of the day, it is the full software stack optimization that matters.\r\n\r\nWe see the same trend for FP8 MFU, improving from 29.5% MFU to 39.5% MFU in that same time, for a 34% improvement in throughput from just software gains alone.\r\n\r\nTurning to costs, assuming a cost of $1.42/hr/GPU excluding any rental margin, we see that the cost to train GPT-3 175B on FP8 went from 72 cents per 1M tokens trained in Jan 2024 to just 54.2 cents per million tokens by Dec 2024. That means that the cost to train GPT-3 175B when using the original training token count of 300B ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165 ) improved from $218k in Jan 2024 to only $162k by Dec 2024.\r\n\r\nFinally, we examine the power consumption from training GPT-3. We estimate the all in power draw for the 128 H100 cluster inclusive of GPUs, CPUs, networking, storage and other components. We then gross this up by the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of a typical colocation data center to arrive the all-in utility Joules per token.\r\n\r\nAs an unwelcome flashback to high school physics, a Joule is a unit of energy that is equivalent the work done when a force of 1 Newton moves an object 1 meter in the direction of the force. Lighting an incandescent 60W light bulb for one second consumes 60 Joules (a Watt (W) is a unit of energy consumption per second) and consumes 216kJ per hour. An alternative way to express units of energy is to use watt-hours or kilowatt-hours, which is just the power of a device multiplied by the number of hours which it is utilized over. The average annual US household in 2022 consumed 10,791kWh of energy or approximately 38,847,600,000 Joules. Dividing this 10,791 kWh by 8,760 hours per year gives us 1,232 W of power on average over the year – a little more than the 1,200W used by a single GB200 GPU!\r\n\r\nWe see that each token trained consumes 2.46 Joules for FP8 and 3.63 Joules for BF16 when using the December 2024 version of NVIDIA software. If we had an energy budget equivalent to the average US household’s annual energy consumption, we could train 15.8B FP8 tokens. Extending this calculation further, training 300B tokens on GPT3 175B would require 19 annual US households’ worth of energy consumption for FP8 and 28 households’ worth of annual energy consumption for BF16.\r\n\r\nGPT-3’s total training cost of $162k and 19 households’ annual energy consumption doesn’t sound excessive, but it is the many experiments and many failed training runs that add up to the ballooning energy growth from AI Training we are seeing now in the United States.\r\n\r\n----------------------\r\nWeak vs Strong Scaling\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nStrong and weak scaling describe the performance improvement of scaling compute resources for different problem setups, for instance, different batch sizes.\r\n\r\nStrong scaling refers to scaling compute resources while keeping the model size and global batch size the same. In such a case, Amdahl’s Law, which describes the speedup that can be achieved by parallelizing computing steps, can be used to quantify the speedup of strong scaling.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, weak scaling refers to scaling compute resources to solve larger problems at a constant time. AI Training inherently utilizes weak scaling since you can scale up your model size and your global batch size (depending on convergence) by scaling up the number of GPUs used a training job.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis, Performance and Scalability – SCENET Summer School ( https://acenet-arc.github.io/ACENET_Summer_School_General/05-performance/index.html )\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLlama3 405B Token/s/GPU, Cost Per Million Tokens, Joules Per Token vs Number of GPUs (Weak Scaling)\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn this benchmark, we examine how training performance for Llama3 405B varies as we increase the number of H100 GPUs in the cluster – an example of weak scaling.\r\n\r\nIn the table below, we see how as we increase the GPU cluster size from 576 H100s to 2,304 H100s, both FP8 MFU and BF16 MFU hover around 43% MFU and 54% MFU respectively across all sizes. In the training run published in the Llama 3 Herd of Models Paper ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783 ) , researchers used 16k H100s to train Llama 3 405B, achieving a BF16 MFU of 41% ( https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783 ) for pretraining using a similar parallelism strategy. Note that the above pre-training runs used a sequence length of 8192, whereas for mid-training context extension, each sample’s sequence length is 131,072 instead of 8,192. This longer sequence length requires context parallelism across 16 nodes resulting in MFU dropping to 38% due to the additional communication needed for ring attention.\r\n\r\nTurning to total cost of training, we see that carrying out just the pre-training run, training Llama 3 405B over 15T tokens, costs $1.95 per million tokens when training using BF16 using a 2,304 H100 cluster. This adds up to $29.1M just for the pretraining phase, which is dramatically higher than mixture of expert models such as DeepSeek – which cost only $5M per training run.\r\n\r\nOf course, we stress once more that this cost reflects the cost for a single final successful training run and the cost of the many experiments needed to get to that final stage as well as the cost of employing researchers, among other costs.\r\n\r\nSince Llama3 405B is approximately 2.3x larger than GPT3 175B in terms of total parameter count, the all-in utility Joules per token is about 2.3x greater for Llama 3 405B vs GPT3 175B at 8.8 Joules per token vs 3.6 Joules per token respectively.\r\n\r\nThis means that for the same energy as the average US household consumes in a year, Meta can train 4.4B tokens on Llama3 405B on BF16. To train to convergence using 15T tokens, Meta would require an amount of energy equal to the annual consumption of an entire neighborhood of 3,400 US households.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLlama3 70B Training Performance Token/s/GPU, Cost Per Million Tokens, Joules Per Token vs Number of GPUs (Weak Scaling)\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNext, we look at Llama3 70B training performance for different cluster sizes. As we increase the cluster size from 64 H100s to 2,048 H100s, we see that performance for FP8 drops by 10%, dropping from 38.1% for 64 GPUs down to 35.5% for 2,048 GPUs. It is quite interesting that the MFU drops by so much (on a percentage basis – which is what really matters given the low MFU base) because the per data replica batch size doesn’t change as we scale up and the parallelism also strategy doesn’t change. All runs still continue to use TP=4,PP=2, and context parallel=2 – the only real change is adding more data replicas. Interestingly, for BF16, the drop in MFU is far smaller at only 1-2%, dropping from 54.5% MFU for 64 H100s down to 53.7% for 2,408 GPUs.\r\n\r\nLlama3 405B is 5.7x larger than Llama3 70B, and as with any dense models, the number of FLOPs required is linear with respect to the number of parameters. As such, the cost to train Llama 3 405B should be 5.7x greater than that of Llama 3 70B. In practice, at the ~2k H100 scale, Llama3 405B is 5.4x more expensive in terms of the cost per million tokens using BF16.\r\n\r\nIn terms of power consumption, we see that for FP8, training consumes 10% more energy per token when training on 2,408 H100s vs 64 H100s. To train Llama 3 70B to convergence with 15T tokens on FP8 using at 64 H100s would only use energy equal to 440 US households’ annual energy consumption, whereas at the 2,048 H100 scale, we would require energy equivalent to 472 US households’ annual energy consumption.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nLlama3 8B Training Performance Over Time\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLarger models like Llama3 405B and Llama3 70B both use tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism and data parallelism, but training Llama3 8B only requires context parallelism across the 8,192 sequence length for each pair of GPUs within the NVLink domain and uses data parallelism to spread the work beyond across other pairs of GPUs. In this analysis – we also look at training performance with respect to time in order to gauge how software improvements across the stack have affected training performance. We see that performance has only improved slightly from November 2024 to April 2025, the latter date being a full 23 months after Hopper began mass deployment.\r\n\r\nIn the next section, we deep dive into the current state of GB200 NVL72 training performance as compared to training on the H100. We will discuss benchmarks from training DeepSeek 670B MoE and Llama4 400B MoE, analyzing GB200’s performance per total cost of ownership (TCO) vs that of the H100.\r\n\r\nWe will also zoom into the aforementioned lack of effective GB200 NVL72 diagnostic and debugging tools and discuss the many issues contributing to the unreliability of GB200 NVL72. These are the challenges that NVIDIA, CSPs, Neoclouds and the end users at frontier labs must solve in order to successfully and cost effectively train frontier models on the GB200 NVL72 before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to get access\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nRead more of this content when you subscribe today.\r\n\r\nLog In ( https://semianalysis.com/wp-json/passport/v1/oauth/authlogin )\r\n\r\nSubscription Information\r\n\r\nMember: Subscriber\r\nEmail: kelan@bytedance.com\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to SemiAnalysis ( https://semianalysis.com/wp-json/passport/v1/oauth/refresh ).\r\n\r\nClick here ( https://semianalysis.passport.online/member/account ) to view your account, manage your subscriptions, or unsubscribe from emails.\r\n\r\n© 2025 SemiAnalysis LLC ( https://semianalysis.com/wp-json/passport/v1/oauth/refresh )",

Creative ways to fund open source projects\r\nEvery engineer and tech company likes open source projects, but few are willing to pay for them. This is fine for a while – enthusiasm to support a project does go a long way – but after some time, maintainers of popular projects could burn out or just stop supporting the project. Recently, I came across two creative approaches of maintainers generating revenue for open source projects that also see significant commercial usage.\r\nOpen source maintenance fee: an interesting experiment\r\nWix Toolset [ https://substack.com/redirect/bb6504d0-5899-4cd6-9691-0a91bec81808?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] is a set of open source tools for creating Windows installers. As with most open source projects, the long-term financial sustainability of the project was uncertain: who would pay for core maintainers to spend time on this project, rather than on their work or other side projects? A project like Wix needs to be continuously updated to support new versions of Windows, and security and other issues must be responded to by maintainers, who also review pull requests.\r\nThe team decided to adopt a relatively new concept called the Open Source Maintenance Fee [ https://substack.com/redirect/d30e46f1-c35d-4674-bc2a-3392e5b559b6?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]. How it works:\r\nThe code is freely available under an open source license\r\nOpening issues or commenting on them, or participating in releases or pull requests requires paying the fee\r\nBasically, if an individual or business uses Wix Toolset as part of its revenue-generating activity, and someone from that company wants to ask questions or submit changes, then it’s necessary to become a sponsor and pay:\r\n$10/month when working at a company up to 20 people\r\n$40/month for companies of 20-100 employees\r\n$60/month for companies with 100+ employees\r\nSo far, the fee seems to be working: The project currently has 64 sponsors, including Microsoft (which needs to pay the $60/month fee). This could be generating anything from $640/month up to a few thousand dollars per month, which can be used to cover costs, such as compensating core contributors. As maintainer Rob Menshing elaborated [ https://substack.com/redirect/f5780560-6bbd-4ab5-a280-b7b2d5be20b4?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]:\r\n“The maintenance fee is intended to go to those doing maintenance. In my project, there are two of us working to keep the project running. We have contributors who do stuff they find interesting, but none of them do ‘boring but important stuff’.\r\nSo far, it is working.”\r\nWhat I like about this structure is that it removes the burden on maintainers who invest their time, and turns it into an incentive for commercial users to pay for their time.\r\nI wonder if GitHub’s popularity means more projects will implement a similar fee. GitHub has become the de facto place for open source projects to live: its simple, intuitive UI makes it very easy to open an issue and raise a pull request.\r\nHowever, open source maintainers of more popular projects face a steady stream of often low-quality issues raised, and pull requests which aren’t ready to be merged. Meanwhile, users expect responses and can get frustrated when issues are not quickly resolved.\r\nFor open source projects with significant commercial usage, an open source maintenance fee could be a viable way to reduce this kind of noise, and generate some revenue for the time maintainers spend on them. For example, the Wix Toolset project currently has 775 open issues [ https://substack.com/redirect/7882acb9-5c04-437d-a018-f90e6265111c?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (!) and another 6,500 closed ones [ https://substack.com/redirect/ef7bf2c8-e0ed-4b0c-9d02-ae703b948e65?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]. Just keeping on top of the issues raised looks like a lot of work!\r\nFor projects that do not use GitHub, the barrier to entry for creating issues and pull requests is a lot higher. For example, Linux still runs on email mailing lists, and patches need to be sent via email. To contribute to Linux, a lot of upfront work is necessary first. We cover more about contributing to Linux in the episode of the Pragmatic Engineer Podcast, How Linux is built with Greg Kroah-Hartman [ https://substack.com/redirect/6525a39e-fb17-4421-8e1c-d0be0201aaed?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].\r\nA fee like this could help keep open source projects as free and open source software (FOSS). Someone might argue that the existence of a fee goes against the concept of “free”. However, the “free” in FOSS stands for the freedom to:\r\nRun the program as you wish for any purpose (you can do this!)\r\nStudy how the program works and modify it as you wish (you can do this; just get the code and change it, or fork it!)\r\nRedistribute copies to help others (you can do this)\r\nDistribute copies of modified versions (again, you can do this)\r\nFOSS shouldn’t mean that someone works for free in replying to issues and responding to change requests. In the case of Wix Toolset, maintainer Rob Menshing worked hard [ https://substack.com/redirect/c6beba09-6108-43af-ac55-d24ffcf72d72?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] with lawyers to ensure that this Open Source Maintainer Fee is fully compliant with FOSS principles and expectations. As Rob put it [ https://substack.com/redirect/c6beba09-6108-43af-ac55-d24ffcf72d72?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]:\r\n“OSS does not mean that everything is available for no cost.”\r\nThe more open source projects on GitHub are sustainable, the better it will be for the tech ecosystem. An open source project that is sustainable long-term – with maintainers having a reasonable workload, keeping up with comments, and releasing new versions when needed – is a lot better than one that puts up no such barriers and leads maintainers to throw in the towel and quit.\r\nDon’t forget, any company or individual who does not want to pay this fee but does want to make modifications to the code can go ahead and do it! They just need to create their fork and then can go ahead with the modification. The cost of keeping this fork up-to-date with the project then becomes theirs to pay and it could be more expensive than the $10-60/month fee asked for by the project.\r\nWhen introducing the fee, the Wix Toolset project had a long discussion; read the thread [ https://substack.com/redirect/8890a0b9-f944-4a9e-848f-d39173747cc4?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] for more details of the thinking behind this move.\r\nEnterprise-only features: how uv’s creator plans to make money\r\nIn the Python world, the uv [ https://substack.com/redirect/f1df48d2-d17b-48ca-9c9a-3e681cbe8bee?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] package manager is surging in popularity: it is ultra-fast and 10-100x speedier than the formerly popular package manager, pip. Part of this speed is thanks to uv being written from scratch, in Rust, for performance. It does lots of clever things like parallel downloading and installing of packages, and maintaining an optimized module cache. uv is so useful that an AI startup told me that moving over to this package manager improved productivity more than any AI tool they trialed. From Software engineering with LLMs in 2025, reality check [ https://substack.com/redirect/68323875-2b27-41ac-a600-25bfe7e66a3e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]:\r\n“An interesting detail emerged when I asked how they would compare the impact of AI tools to other innovations in the field. This engineer said that for their domain, the impact of the uv project manager and ruff linter has been greater than AI tools, since uv made their development experience visibly faster!\r\nuv is built by a startup called Astral that has raised $4M in seed funding in 2023. With VC funding, Astral has to generate revenue, but how to do this with a free open source package manager?\r\nWe now have an answer:\r\nAstral created a private package registry called pyx [ https://substack.com/redirect/2ff304d4-a007-4be4-b74e-b28a5e0da5f2?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], a paid-enterprise focused package registry. It’s like uv, but with additional features for security and GPU support. Astral has signed up companies like Ramp and Intercom as customers already.\r\nThis approach of charging for enterprise features is clever and great news for the open source community: if Astral can get traction for pyx, they could have a business offering standout tools for free to individual developers, and also more advanced paid versions with enterprise features for companies. We have covered the pressure on commercial open source companies to make money [ https://substack.com/redirect/b840ce60-e439-4b59-a8bb-eef02694b0f6?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], so fingers crossed that Astral succeeds!\r\n2.

As a result, remote coding interviews today serve up more noise and less signal than ever. In response to AI “helper” tools for remote interviews, many employers are returning to the in-person interview format – while others accept AI tools and adapt their processes like Shopify [ https://substack.com/redirect/a5370e0c-fdaf-4122-a801-25416ae53f61?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] has.\r\nToday, the most popular interview type remains the algorithmic coding interview, in which candidates have an algorithmic challenge, a whiteboard, and 30-60 minutes to come up with a solution. So, how do you succeed in this new wave of old-style tech job interviews? For some professionals, the approach may not be crystal clear if remote interviews have been the norm.\r\nTo find out, I turned to one of the best people to tackle this question: Mike Mroczka [ https://substack.com/redirect/5c16d1fb-f3fe-47f4-bcfd-5f0c834f6a7d?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], lead author of the book Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview [ https://substack.com/redirect/890b0cf6-b5da-4fec-9e89-a24ff5eb66fd?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]. It is the official sequel to the classic coding interview preparation “bible,” Cracking the Coding Interview [ https://substack.com/redirect/03c2d03f-e9be-49f5-b35f-05352a75239b?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]. Reading the original title first is not a prerequisite for Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview, Mike says. If you are interested in this updated book, you can read nine chapters for free [ https://substack.com/redirect/40992cd0-82d1-4f42-a70d-eadca0db9956?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (the book has 43 chapters in total).\r\nMike worked at Google for nearly 4 years, and has been a dedicated interview coach for a decade. In this article, he shares his approach for acing in-person interviews with a framework aptly named “MIKE,” and advice and tactics for getting unstuck in tough coding interviews. We cover:\r\nThe reality of interviews at Big Tech Some data suggests so. After all, the process has worked for decades and is well understood, meaning it’s unlikely to have been discarded and forgotten. Also: the interview / reality disconnect\r\nMIKE framework: a framework for getting unstuck during coding interviews\r\nMinimally sketch the naive solution\r\nIdentify upper and lower bounds\r\nKeywords in the problem\r\nEmploy boosters when stuck\r\nImportance of preparation and practice. Practice makes all the difference: consider recording yourself in mock interviews, then analyse your performance\r\nThe bottom of this article could be cut off in some email clients. Read the full article uninterrupted, online. [ https://substack.com/redirect/8fba4e9b-08c0-42f3-842d-a04ec9f5ad76?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\n1. The reality of interviews at Big Tech\r\nSeveral companies have started to embrace AI coding tools for interviews, including Meta, which is currently trialing them. Elsewhere, Canva [ https://substack.com/redirect/9444ab47-429f-4e0b-8139-4e7420980634?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] and Shopify [ https://substack.com/redirect/a5370e0c-fdaf-4122-a801-25416ae53f61?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (as mentioned above), encourage candidates to use AI tools during interviews. But adoption like this is far from being a death knell for tried and true interview formats, according to research.\r\nData from leading mock interview site interviewing.io [ https://substack.com/redirect/b44a195f-cbce-4a33-b961-8d8416f41c11?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] shows AI has overwhelmingly NOT made algorithmic interviews redundant at Big Tech. It surveyed 53 Big Tech interviewers, mostly at FAANG companies – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google – and also at a few large scaleups like Stripe. Aline Lerner [ https://substack.com/redirect/a10de535-0fcf-4abd-a4fb-304260074e8a?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], founder at interviewing.io, summarizes the data collected:\r\n“Answering the question of whether AI has changed interview processes:\r\n93% of respondents have confirmed that AI has not driven any changes to their interview process.\r\nOf the 7% who reported changes, these consisted exclusively of adding cheating detection tools to their interviews, rather than modifications to the interview format itself.\r\nNone of the interviewers reported that their companies are moving away from algorithmic questions. Some interviewers did note they're no longer asking questions taken verbatim from LeetCode. Others are making modifications to pre-existing algorithmic questions that make those questions harder for LLMs to answer, asking more follow-up questions of candidates, and/or are incorporating additional discussion into interviews.\r\nIt looks like algorithmic questions are here to stay – at least for the foreseeable future.”\r\nAt search giant Google, they are doubling down on in-person interviews because of AI. In June, CEO Sundar Pichai confirmed Google is bringing back in-person interviews on the Lex Fridman podcast (emphasis mine):\r\nLex Fridman: “Google has legendary coding interviews, like rigorous interviews for the engineers. Can you comment on how that has changed in the era of AI? The whiteboard interview, I assume, is not allowed to have some prompts.”\r\nSundar Pichai: “We are making sure we’ll introduce at least one round of in-person interviews for people just to make sure the fundamentals are there. I think they’ll end up being important, but it’s an equally important skill. Look, if you can use these tools to generate better code, I think that’s an asset. So overall, I think it’s a massive positive”.\r\nAlternatives to in-person algorithmic coding interviews have downsides. The most popular other options are:\r\nRemote algorithmic interviews. Unfortunately, invisible “AI helper” software displays answers in realtime, and is slowly rendering this type of interview useless. Plus, there have been incidents of “AI fakers”, where candidates pretend to be someone else, which also reduces trust in this format, as we’ve previously covered [ https://substack.com/redirect/ff25babb-af77-4b4c-9f58-a0bb32458d97?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].\r\nRemote interviews that allow AI coding tools. This involves setting much more ambitious coding challenges, and doing away with algorithmic questions, like at Shopify [ https://substack.com/redirect/a5370e0c-fdaf-4122-a801-25416ae53f61?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] and Canva [ https://substack.com/redirect/9444ab47-429f-4e0b-8139-4e7420980634?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].\r\nTrial days or trial weeks. A valid criticism of 30-60 minute coding interviews in any format is that they don’t mirror the actual work of engineers. So, why not create an interview that does? Trial days and weeks are the result in both the remote and in-person format, in which candidates join a team and ship a feature to production. Linear uses remote trial days [ https://substack.com/redirect/66812e68-cdb1-4788-a311-ffa5e7a2d376?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] in their interview process, and Automattic holds an async coding challenge [ https://substack.com/redirect/5d705dc1-ec63-4c80-babf-8a202873c0a6?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] as the final “coding” interview, which can take days to complete. The downside is that trial days can add up to a week of time invested. Linear pays candidates for this, but the demand on time can make it hard for some people to commit to.\r\nThe biggest downside of in-person interviews is obviously the cost: candidates must travel to an office, and overnight accommodation may be required. Some employers like Big Tech companies usually foot such bills. For candidates interviewing on Fridays, this process might turn into a free city break, as happened when Uber flew me out from London to interview at its office in Amsterdam, across the North Sea.\r\nWith that, it’s over to Mike…\r\nInterview / reality disconnect\r\nMarket forces and AI-enabled cheating are changing technical interviews, by forcing a move away from verbatim LeetCode questions back to in-person interviews – or something else entirely. In this new world, knowing how to think outweighs memorizing lists of problems. That’s why we decided to write a sequel to “Cracking the Coding Interview [ https://substack.com/redirect/de2f0bdb-90a8-4df3-9743-5a1026695021?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].” Our goal with this new book is to teach the “why” rather than the “what”, and to go deep into problem-solving approaches.\r\nLet’s acknowledge the elephant in the room: data structure and algorithm (DS&A) questions have very little to do with software engineers’ daily lives. When was the last time you implemented a binary search tree from scratch, or used backtracking at work? For many people, the answer is “never, except in an interview.”\r\nThese interviews favor those with time to grind LeetCode. They focus on niche topics most engineers never use, which can make the process feel disconnected from reality, and frankly, a bit demoralizing.\r\nYet despite this, DS&A interviews remain the industry standard at most major tech companies. Why’s that?\r\nIt’s because hiring managers know something many engineers overlook: there simply aren’t better alternatives. Take-homes are easy to cheat on, and system design and behavioral interviews are harder to scale with limited questions and non-technical answers. All the while, DS&A questions remain the most scalable, cheat-resistant way to test problem-solving skills under pressure.\r\nAmid AI-powered cheating and headlines declaring LeetCode dead, Big Tech follows the path of least resistance: rather than invent something unproven, they shift back to in-person interviews to make cheating harder. This format may evolve, but time-pressured coding isn’t going anywhere.\r\nSo, rather than fighting the system, it’s more pragmatic to embrace the “suck”, and learn to become great at these interviews.\r\n2. The MIKE framework: getting unstuck\r\nCoding interviews are meant to challenge you. Even seasoned engineers hit roadblocks, and that’s not failure; it’s the point. Interviewers want to see how you respond when the path forward isn’t obvious. Do you freeze, flail, or push forward with a plan?\r\nThat’s where the MIKE framework comes in. Based on years of real interview experience and refined by teaching thousands of engineers, MIKE is a structured, reliable approach for navigating moments of uncertainty. Success doesn’t come from avoiding confusion, it comes from knowing exactly what to do when it hits.\r\nThe four components of MIKE\r\nThe MIKE framework consists of four main, problem-solving strategies that experienced engineers employ to solve problems when they get stuck:\r\n[M]inimally sketch the naive solution: Start by establishing a baseline approach, even if it’s inefficient. This ensures you understand the problem, and it gives you something to optimize.\r\n[I]dentify upper and lower bounds: Use big O analysis [ https://substack.com/redirect/d88b3a86-6987-4965-b996-02ca61281bfe?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] to narrow down the range of possible solutions. This helps you quickly discard approaches that are too slow or unrealistically fast. See a helpful visual introduction to Big O analysis. [ https://substack.com/redirect/56b3bff8-ca3f-4664-b839-52d8365e1a81?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\n[K]eywords/triggers: Look for hints in the problem statement that suggest specific techniques. For example, a sorted input array might trigger thoughts of binary search, while questions involving parentheses often suggest use of a stack.\r\n[E]mploy boosters: If the first three parts don’t get you unstuck, there’s a series of techniques designed to give you a “boost”. These include optimizing the brute force solution, hunting for useful properties, and ways to decrease difficulty.\r\nThis framework isn’t revolutionary; it simply spells out what good problem solvers do instinctively.\r\nLet’s explore each component in detail.\r\n3. M: Minimally sketch the naive solution\r\nWhen you’re stuck, the first step is to stop worrying about optimization and just find a working approach. Don’t jump into code, just sketch the simplest brute force solution that solves the problem.\r\nWhy Start Naively?\r\nGet the ball rolling. Many candidates chase optimal solutions and end up with nothing. A bad-but-working solution beats no solution at all.\r\nSolve the right problem. If your basic approach fails on examples, you probably misunderstood something.\r\nSet up optimization techniques. Naive solutions are often a stepping stone towards an optimal solution. With a naive solution, you can spot bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and duplicate work that can be optimized (see Booster 1).\r\nHow to Sketch a Naive Solution\r\nYou might ask what “sketch” means in this context. You shouldn’t code a solution, but minimally sketching it is a good use of time. For this, I recommend “indented English”, a middle ground between code and vaguely describing it out loud. It skips syntax and focuses on the code structure using indentation. Avoid full-blown pseudocode, with which it’s too easy to slip into writing real (often buggy) code. Consider the “indented English” on the left which focuses on the high-level idea, vs. the “pseudocode” on the right that has a bug.\r\nPitfalls to avoid:\r\nOverthinking syntax: When writing a high-level idea out, it’s not the time to think through the syntax of conditionals or complex list comprehensions. Explain the idea succinctly, then code.\r\nSkipping non-trivial test cases: We’ve seen candidates skip test cases that don’t follow the happy path of their algorithm. Run through non-trivial examples to make sure an idea is sound.\r\nHandling logic for trivial test cases: Sometimes, we see candidates wasting time on trivial test cases. You don’t need to write the logic on how to handle empty arrays; just write a one-line reminder like, “TODO: handle empty array,” to show the interviewer you’re aware of the test case.\r\nWriting actual code: We’ve seen candidates write working Python code inside of a comment string and call it “pseudocode”.\r\nStarting with a naive solution gives clarity, confidence, and a launchpad for optimization. Once that’s locked in, then you can move on to performance.\r\nThe solution to the bug in the code: We are mixing types in the Python code – which is a common problem in Python. The line “for row in grid” gives us a list, and not an array. Because of this, the following line (“for col in len(grid[row])”) would not work.\r\nThe correct code would be this:\r\nfor row in range(len(grid)): \r\n  for col in range(len(grid[row])):\r\nApplying step “M” to a real interview problem:\r\nProblem: Increasing Triplet Subsequence [ https://substack.com/redirect/8116a7ff-6147-4957-b5c5-b9f46828a7ec?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\nGiven an integer array arr, return true if there exists a triple of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k and arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k]. If no such indices exists, return false.\r\nExample 1: arr = [8, 5, 4, 9, 7, 6, 5, 6, 4]\r\nOutput: True. There are three values in increasing order (4 < 5 < 6) and their indices are also in increasing order (2 < 6 < 7).\r\n\r\nExample 2: arr = [9, 8, 7, 6]\r\nOutput: False. No such triplet exists.\r\n\r\nExample 3: arr = [3, 2, 6, 1, 5, 8]\r\nOutput: True. There are five valid triplets:\r\n• 3, 6, 8; (indices 0, 2, 5)\r\n• 3, 5, 8; (indices 0, 4, 5)\r\n• 2, 6, 8; (indices 1, 2, 5)\r\n• 2, 5, 8; (indices 1, 4, 5)\r\n• 1, 5, 8; (indices 3, 4, 5)\r\nIf your spidey senses are tingling, it may be because you’ve heard of a similar problem called 3Sum [ https://substack.com/redirect/cffb64c5-584f-43b9-82c9-2126d94366e0?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]. The same brute force solution with nested loops would work here and look like this:\r\nAlgo 1: Nested loops\r\nn = len(arr)\r\nTime: O(n^3)\r\nSpace: O(1)\r\n\r\nvalid_triplet(arr):\r\n for i in arr\r\n  for j in arr\r\n   for k in arr     \r\n    // if indices and values are in increasing order\r\n    if i < j < k and arr[i] < arr[j] < arr[k]  \r\n    return True  \r\n  return False\r\nThe skeleton of a solution can be sketched in just a minute or two. While our approach is not optimal, it helps convey to an interviewer that you understand the question and the naive way to tackle the problem. And it’s a starting point for optimizations.\r\nWe will continue to revisit this problem throughout as we work through the framework.\r\n4. I: Identify upper and lower bounds\r\nAfter minimally sketching a naive solution, we suggest identifying the upper and lower bounds for your algorithm’s time complexity (the next steps can be in any order). This process of identifying boundaries, which we call boundary thinking, helps narrow down the range of possible solutions and guides you toward the optimal approach.\r\nWhat is boundary thinking?\r\nA lower bound establishes a threshold below which no solutions can exist. If a problem has a lower bound of O(n), it means we can’t solve it in O(log n) time, or anything faster than O(n). This helps us avoid wasting time on trying to optimize beyond what’s theoretically possible.\r\nAn upper bound establishes a threshold above which solutions are not worth considering. While we can always create slower algorithms, the upper bound helps us discard approaches that are too inefficient to pass the interview.\r\nEstablishing lower bounds\r\nThere are two main types of lower bounds to consider:\r\nOutput-size lower bound: This one is straightforward: the output size is a lower bound for the runtime. With a sequential algorithm, we can’t output an array of size O(n) in less than O(n) time; that’s how long it takes just to write it.\r\nFor example, in the Increasing Triplet Subsequence problem, if we were asked to return all increasing triplets, the output size would be cubic (think of an already-sorted array), meaning that our brute force algorithm would already be optimal.\r\nIf the output is just a number or Boolean, the O(1) lower bound isn’t very constraining, but for problems with potentially large outputs – like finding all combinations or permutations – this bound can be quite useful.\r\nTask-based lower bound: Sometimes, regardless of the approach, there’s a fundamental “task” that any solution must perform. The runtime of this task establishes a lower bound.\r\nFor instance, if we need to find a specific value in an unsorted array, we must check every element in the worst case, giving us a task-based lower bound of O(n). This immediately rules out any approaches that would work in O(log n) or O(1) time.\r\nCommon task-based lower bounds include:\r\nO(n) for problems requiring the processing of each input element at least once\r\nO(n log n) for problems that inherently require comparison-based sorting\r\nO(2n) for problems that require all subsets of the input to be found, like generating a power set\r\nWhen we have both output-size and task-based lower bounds, we take the greater of the two as our final lower bound.\r\nEstablishing upper bounds\r\nSimilarly, there are two main approaches to establishing upper bounds:\r\nNaive upper bound: The time complexity of the naive solution serves as an initial upper bound. If your brute force approach runs in O(n³) time, then you know you don’t need to consider anything slower.\r\nThis bound is particularly useful because you’ve already done the work of sketching the naive solution in the first step of the MIKE framework.\r\nTime Limit Exceeded (TLE) upper bound: This one is a bit strange. In online coding assessments, when a submitted solution is too slow, we get a “Time Limit Exceeded” message. We can anticipate whether a solution will be too slow in an online assessment or interview by understanding the problem’s constraints.\r\nFor example:\r\nIf n ≤ 10, an O(n!) approach might be acceptable\r\nIf n ≤ 20, an O(2n) approach might work\r\nIf n ≤ 500, consider O(n³) approaches or better\r\nIf n ≤ 104, consider O(n²) approaches or better\r\nIf n ≤ 106, consider O(n log n) and O(n) approaches or better\r\nThese aren’t hard rules, but they are guidance. If you aren’t given problem constraints during an in-person interview you can always ask the interviewer for them, but be mindful that not everyone will provide useful responses to such a nuanced question.\r\nWhen we have both the naive and TLE upper bounds, we take the lesser of the two as our final upper bound.\r\nHow does identifying boundaries help?\r\nWe know what you’re thinking: “that’s a lot of effort. How does it help?” To find out, let’s take a practical example with a new problem.\r\nProblem: maximum tunnel depth\r\nYou're given an nxn binary matrix, tunnel, representing a tunnel network that archeologists have excavated. The ground level is above the first row. The first row is at depth 0, and each subsequent row is deeper underground.\r\n1’s represent excavated tunnel pathways in the network.\r\n0’s represent earth that has not been excavated yet.\r\nThe tunnel starts at the top-left and top-right corners (the cells (0, 0) and (0, n - 1) are always 1’s) and consists of a single connected network. Since the tunnel represents a single connected component in the grid, an input like this would not be valid because there is a 1 that is unreachable:\r\ntunnel = [ [1,0,0,1],\r\n[1,1,1,1],\r\n[0,0,0,0],\r\n[0,0,0,1], <- Disconnected 1, so the input is not valid!\r\n]\r\nWrite a function that returns the maximum tunnel depth.\r\nPause for a minute; really stop and think through the following questions before proceeding:\r\nHow would you go about solving this problem?\r\nMinimally sketch the naive solution. What does a “naive” solution look like?\r\nIdentify upper and lower bounds. In particular, can you derive any insights on the best conceivable runtime for this question?\r\nMax tunnel depth solution\r\nHopefully, you tried to answer the questions above before reading this!\r\nHow would you go about solving this problem?\r\nIf you’re like most engineers with a reasonable amount of data structures and algorithms experience, your first thought might be to use a graph traversal, like a depth-first search or breadth-first search. Given that the matrix is square, our time complexity would be O(n2), and the space complexity would be similar since we have to track visited cells to avoid cycles (plus the recursive call stack in a DFS).\r\nWhat does the “naive” solution look like?\r\nThe first step in our MIKE framework helps us identify this second (simpler!) approach. If we step back and ask if there are other ways to find the maximum depth, most people notice a significantly more straightforward solution: traverse the tunnel matrix with a pair of nested loops.\r\nLooping through the tunnel directly lets us record the deepest point without the need to write a whole graph traversal. Because the tunnel input is guaranteed to always be connected, we don’t have to worry about finding stray ones in the tunnel that would throw off our depth count.\r\nThe time complexity would be identical to the graph traversal in the worst case, O(n2), but the space complexity is actually better since it is constant (O(1)).\r\nWhat happens when we apply boundary thinking to the problem?\r\nThe naive approach alone is a novel solution, since it is uncommon for the straightforward approach to be better than a common algorithmic one. However, if we apply boundary thinking we can squeeze more out of this problem.\r\nWe’ve already identified a constant space solution with a quadratic time complexity, so if there are improvements to be made, they will need to be with the time complexity. Is this possible? Let’s identify the upper and lower bounds to find out.\r\nNaive upper bound: O(n²) to iterate through the entire matrix.\r\nLower bound: The output is just a number, so the output-size lower bound is O(1). The task-based lower bound isn’t immediately clear: do we need to check every cell? Your gut might say “yes”, but we should default to the output-size lower bound if we’re uncertain.\r\nWith bounds of O(1) to O(n2), we should consider approaches from constant time upwards, carefully considering each option within the range:\r\nO(1): Seems unlikely for a grid problem\r\nO(log n): Binary search, searching in a tree?\r\nO(n): Scanning just a fraction of the grid?\r\nO(n log n): A sorting solution, heaps, or some combination of the above?\r\nO(n²): Our naive solution\r\nMapping time complexities to possible algorithmic approaches helps narrow the choices. These mappings give clues for the options to try: linear scans, binary search, sorting, and trees.\r\nAfter just a minute or two of experimentation, it is fairly obvious that sorting breaks our input and doesn’t seem to help. We can similarly eliminate tree-based solutions like heaps, as there is no clear way to use them. The binary search idea is intriguing, but how can we apply it? Consider the following input. Can we repeatedly halve something to help narrow the search range?\r\ntunnel = [ [1,0,0,1],\r\n[1,0,1,1],\r\n[1,1,1,0],\r\n[0,0,0,0],\r\n[0,0,0,0],\r\n[0,0,0,0],\r\n[0,0,0,0],\r\n]\r\nIf we check the middle row in the tunnel matrix and scan through it, we will always find one of two scenarios:\r\nWe encounter a 1 in the scanned row. Since we know this must be part of the tunnel, we eliminate the top half of the matrix from our search. We know the maximum depth is at least that middle row or lower in the matrix.\r\nWe do not encounter a 1 in the scanned row. Since the tunnel is a single connected component that starts at the top, any row without a 1 means no further rows can contain the connected tunnel.\r\nRepeating this binary search approach will lead to an O(n log n) solution that’s better than our naive O(n²) approach. Using boundary thinking helps us identify a non-obvious optimization that significantly improves the solution’s efficiency.\r\nBoundary thinking is a powerful tool that avoids wasting time on impossible optimizations or unnecessarily complex solutions. By establishing clear bounds, you focus your problem-solving efforts where they’re most likely to bear fruit.\r\nRevisiting the increasing triplet sequence with boundary thinking\r\nLet’s see how boundary thinking applies to our Increasing Triplet Sequence [ https://substack.com/redirect/8116a7ff-6147-4957-b5c5-b9f46828a7ec?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] problem:\r\nUpper bound: As we sketched in step ‘M’, the naive solution is three nested loops with a time complexity of O(n3), which serves as the naive upper bound. No constraints are given, so we can’t deduce a TLE upper bound.\r\nLower bound: The problem asks for a Boolean output (true or false). Thus, the output-size lower bound is O(1), which isn’t very restrictive. To determine if an increasing triplet exists, we must, at a minimum, inspect the elements of the input array. Therefore, the task-based lower bound is O(n). Unlike the tunnel problem, there is nothing obvious to repeatedly halve, so it’s hard to imagine finding a valid triplet without looking at most – if not all – elements in the array in some cases.\r\nGiven our upper bound of O(n3) and our lower bound of O(n), we should focus on algorithms that take O(n) or O(n log n) time, with O(n2) as a possibility (O(n2) is the optimal runtime for 3Sum).\r\n5. K: Keywords in the problem\r\nThe third step in the MIKE framework is to look for keywords that act as triggers to try a specific approach with a particular data structure or algorithm. This technique, which we call “trigger thinking”, is a powerful shortcut that experienced engineers use intuitively. Triggers might show up in the input type, output type, constraints, problem description, or even during failed attempts to solve the problem...\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.Ef6CxYPPJu87rVD8XJM2bkrtotp0jVeMk_CXNqlif6s?",

向世界和你随机发问：这些问题都是谁有答案呀？！》算是我满足职业理想的一期播客，它被剪到四个半小时实在是因为这是播客内容时长的极限和绝大部分听友能接受的极限，却不是我提问的极限。倘若可以，我可以提问24小时不停歇。\r\n有一句话是：“想知道你热爱什么？看看你把自由支配的时间用在了哪里。”我在大学四年和工作五年的闲暇时间里，把我绝大部分的时间给了各式各样的访谈节目，正经严肃的，轻松愉快的，戏谑辛辣的，我风卷残云地吸入，有时候因为时间有限但是我都不想错过，我甚至偶尔同时在电脑上开4个访谈节目的窗口，一起看看当天的哪个最好。\r\n徐熙娣，蔡康永，柴静，鲁豫，易立竞，杨澜，许戈辉，李静，锵锵三人行，阿雅，甚至现在已经不在访谈届活跃的张丹丹，已经消失的光线巨多主持人群访的节目，都是我自由时间的美味主菜。我所学的专业和我的职业理想毫无关系，但是我每日都在闲暇时间给自己进行无意识的职业训练。\r\n我还尤其热爱观看采访者采访采访者(一个套娃）的节目，对我简直是饕餮盛宴，比如鲁豫在节目里采访杨澜，采访许戈辉，前些天我还看到鲁豫和易立竞的对谈，这些能给我带来的满足简直是无可比拟的：因为从她们的对谈中，我能学习到更多关于采访，关于提问的秘诀，了解她们如何做准备工作的，如何在恐惧退却不安时向前一步提问的。每次学到一点点，我都有偷蜜盗香的快乐。\r\n在学习了这么多，我如今决定也来进一步实现一下自己的职业理想了。\r\n先以文字的方式开始，在newsletter（https://afterschool2021.substack.com/）和游荡者平台（www.youdangzhe.com）开启我的“莫问世界Echoing the World （英文名源于我的名字Echo和我想听到世界的回声-echo）”系列。我第一波要采访的对象，就是来自世界各地的游荡者们。\r\n为什么要向游荡者进行提问呢？\r\n因为从故乡故土离开，前往世界游荡，需要莫大的勇气和弹性。而拥有勇气和弹性的人，可能性也最辽阔。我想通过我的采访和提问，把勇敢者的故事记录下来，分享出去。我也相信在游荡路上的人，过着更intense（激烈强烈）的生活，也更有希望和可能，在生活的变动和自我的主动中，找到生活的答案。\r\n这是“莫问世界 Echoing the World”的开篇第一篇，我采访我在荷兰语课上结识的土耳其同学Elif.\r\nElif和妈妈在3年前以难民的身份来到荷兰。我对Elif的生活非常感兴趣，是因为她极其聪明，荷兰语是我们班上最好的，我非常喜欢课上和她结伴对话。她也特别友好和乐于助人，在我需要紧急搬家的时候还帮我找房子。\r\n同时ELif还是女权主义者，课上聊到婚姻给女性带来的灾难时我俩还跨越桌子击掌。她还非常美丽，穿的衣服也非常好看，每次去学校上课我都会看看她今天又穿了什么好看的衣服，我俩还一起讨论买的vintage衣服。\r\n而且我还从Elif这里知道，荷兰享誉世界的国花郁金香，恰恰是来源于土耳其。郁金香从土耳其被商人带到了荷兰，开启了“郁金香泡沫”，也开始了郁金香蜚声国际的历程。\r\nElif像郁金香一样美丽，也从土耳其来到了荷兰。她当下的一切看起来都非常好，像春日复活节在荷兰暖阳下摇曳生辉的郁金香。所以我尤其想知道，她是如何这么好的，经历过怎样的困难和波折，才抵达如今的“好”。\r\n下面是我和Elif的问答，希望也能对你有所启发。\r\n访谈以英文进行，我率先把中文翻译版放在了下面便于阅读。文末还有英文原文，感兴趣的朋友可在阅读完中文后也浏览英文(可能英文能更加表达受访者的情感和感受）。也从这个系列开始这个频道会逐步开始有更多英文的内容（播客也是，明年说不定会有专属的英文系列）！\r\n莫问世界1：莫不谷访谈Elif\r\n1. 你是什么时候来到荷兰的？\r\nElif: 我是在 2022 年 8 月来到荷兰的，月初抵达，月底申请的难民庇护。\r\n莫笔记：我是在2021年8月底来到荷兰的，刚好比Elif早了一年，现在是2025年8月底。8月是荷兰一年中最后美好的时间，在那之后风雨就会逐步到来，白天开始变短，气温开始下降，夜晚逐步更早地来临。\r\n2. 当时为什么觉得必须要离开你所处的国家？是什么让你觉得留在那里不可能或者不安全？\r\nElif: 当时土耳其的总统埃尔多安与宗教领袖居伦之间存在政治问题。居伦的运动旨在传播爱、和平，更重视宗教、礼仪和教育。2016 年土耳其发生了政变，总统埃尔多安将其政变归咎于居伦及其追随者，并开始抓捕所有支持居伦的人（很多居伦的支持者在政府任职）。妈妈的朋友们一个接一个被拘捕入狱，这让她非常害怕，所以我们决定来到荷兰。\r\n莫笔记：我从Elif这里第一次知道了“居伦运动”这个词，因为我此前非常好奇，土耳其并没有战争，怎么能够以难民身份来到荷兰申请政治庇护呢？搜索了居伦运动才知道土耳其总统将和自己政见不同的居伦和其支持者定义为了“恐怖分子”，大肆抓捕了居伦同情者或参与者。很多人只是学校的老师和公司的职员，也被逮捕入狱。很多时候当权者会以各种名义抓捕政见或者利益不同者，这在很多国家屡见不鲜，比如大家所熟知的“打黑运动”和不一定熟知的709大抓捕。\r\n3. 为什么选择了荷兰？做这个决定考虑了哪些因素？ \r\nElif：我们研究了几个国家，比如芬兰、法国和荷兰，最后决定来荷兰，因为荷兰的庇护程序更完善，人权也更受重视。所以我们觉得荷兰是最合适的选择。\r\n莫笔记：这是3年前的荷兰，而去年荷兰右翼政党PVV登台，对难民和移民都提出了极其严苛的提案。庆幸的是PVV党魁今年夏天因为提出疯狂的反难民和移民的法案，得到了大家的反对，他已经怒而辞职。荷兰正在准备新的大选，我今天看到他又要再次参加选举，竞选内容包括全面停止难民接收。在全球转右的风潮中，难民需求政治庇护愈发艰难。而目前无休无止的战争和政治矛盾，正在创造越来越多的难民。\r\n4. 最后是以怎样的方式来到荷兰的？有经历很多麻烦和波折吗？从原本的国家来荷兰花了多少时间，多少钱？\r\nElif: 我们持土耳其护照合法乘飞机来到荷兰。因为我和妈妈有一种叫“绿色护照”的特殊护照，所以不需要签证（政府员工工作后可获得）。我们先飞到法国，再开车来荷兰。具体花费现在我已经记不清了。\r\n莫笔记：可见一个好护照，和会开车的技能，之于游荡中的女性多么重要！\r\n5. 来到荷兰后第一个月经历了什么？申请难民身份的流程顺利吗？需要待在难民中心吗？\r\nElif: 刚来荷兰的第一个月非常糟糕。当我们决定申请庇护时，有很多庇护申请者和难民，Ter Apel 和其它难民营都很满。我们非常担心我们我们会不得不在难民营外面待几天。虽然风险很大，但幸运的是我们最终没有待在外面。难民营的工作人员为妇女、儿童和家庭提供食物和床位，但单身男性只能在满员的情况下暂时待在外面。前三天我们住在 Ter Apel，那地方很糟糕。\r\nTer Apel 是主要的难民中心，所有申请庇护的人都必须去那里。之后，你要么继续住在那里，要么被送到其他难民中心。我们在 Ter Apel 待了三天后，被送到一个紧急避难所，是一个学校的大体育馆，位于 Exloo，离 Ter Apel 大约 30-40 分钟车程。Exloo 是一个小而漂亮的村庄。由于难民数量多且住宿不足，这些地方被改造成临时避难所。我们在那里待了一周，没有隐私，每个人都在大大厅里睡觉，我记得大约 70-100 人，可能更多。\r\n我们在这Exloo这个避难所早餐和晚餐。我在那里听到人们说荷兰语，当时觉得这门语言很难学，不知道如何开始学😭。当天气转冷后，我们被送到 Oss，在那里住了 2 年半。一开始到Oss我们在学校待了 3-5 个月，也是临时避难所，然后搬到预制房间。我们在 Oss 的难民营算是比较漂亮的营地，有很多活动和志愿者工作，们教我们荷兰语，我就是这样开始学习荷兰语。\r\n莫笔记：Ter Apel是荷兰东北部格罗宁根省的一个很大的村子，和德国毗邻，很多寻求政治庇护的难民会被短暂安置在这里。我用地图绘制了Elif在荷兰3年内的生活动线，从北部来到了南部，跨越了大半个荷兰。\r\n6. 现在对荷兰的感受还和第一个月一样吗？经历了哪些变化呢？\r\nElif: 最初几个月，我觉得荷兰更好。现在这里一切都变贵了。我还是不喜欢下雨😭。有句荷兰谚语说：“你不是糖做的”，意思是你不会在雨中融化，但我觉得自己会哈哈。我仍然认为荷兰是一个美丽的国家。\r\n莫笔记：因为俄罗斯发起的对乌克兰的战争，带来了荷兰整体物价的上涨，也导致了荷兰人对难民和移民情绪的转变。之于难民和移民而言，荷兰都不如过去几年更好。当然整个世界也都如此。今天在新的荷兰语课上，我还把elif说的这句谚语分享给了来自智利的同学，她说她觉得自己糖，会在荷兰的雨中融化。土耳其和智利，都是比荷兰更少雨，晴朗的日子更多的国家。然而现在气候变化强烈，荷兰和伦敦这种往日多雨的地方最近半年很少下雨，而北京这种干燥的地方整个夏天成为了热带雨林，变得潮湿。有时候气候变化，甚至比人迁移的变化，更强烈。\r\n7. 迄今为止喜欢在荷兰的生活吗？有哪些喜欢的，有哪些不喜欢的？\r\nElif: 我喜欢在荷兰的生活。我爱参加派对、音乐节，荷兰是玩乐的最佳国家，而且荷兰人很会享受生活。但每个城市都差不多，有教堂、运河、同样的房屋建筑。虽然我喜欢建筑，但久了有点无聊。我不喜欢这里的交通系统，很糟糕，价格高，而且下雨时火车总是晚点，这让我很奇怪。\r\n莫笔记：因为我之前3年都生活在鹿特丹，一个二战后新建的城市，和荷兰所有城市都不一样，相反我住的地方和纽约的曼哈顿特别像，所以我对此的感受略有不同。不过荷兰的交通真的是相当昂贵，比欧洲消费最高的地方瑞士苏黎世的交通费用更昂贵。很多人通勤都是靠火车，很多地方火车通勤往返费用在20-40欧，而苏黎世10瑞郎买的火车票可以24小时内随便坐多少趟，还能用来坐船。\r\n8. 如果可以回到你做决定的时刻，你还会选择荷兰吗？还是会考虑另一个国家？为什么？\r\nElif: 这是个好问题，我不太确定怎么回答，但我仍然会选择荷兰，因为这里繁荣程度高，自由度比其他国家大。\r\n莫笔记：我的答案也是如此，尤其在我游荡完欧洲和全球绝大多数地方后，我依然觉得当初的自己做出了最明智的选择。\r\n9. 如果你可以和另一个人交换人生，你最想和谁交换？\r\nElif: 我想和荷兰人交换人生。并非某个具体的荷兰人，我希望能像荷兰人一样自由说荷兰语，做自己想做的事。\r\n莫笔记：我在荷兰人，巴黎人，苏黎世人，纽约人中间任选，我的前四志愿，任意一个录取我都可以。\r\n10. 你觉得一个人离开自己故乡故土，是一件怎样的事情？是好事还是坏事？为什么？\r\nElif: 这既是好事，也是坏事。大多数人离开家乡是因为那里不够安全，想为自己和家人过更好的生活。离开一切是艰难的，因为你无法预知未来，但怀着希望、尽力而为，会让你走得更远。\r\n莫笔记：我认为之于女性，是永恒的好事。虽然挑战和艰难很多，但是对自我的解放是留在原地绝不可能发生的事情。\r\n11. 离开家乡去另一个国家生活，最需要的品质是什么？最需要克服的困难有哪些？\r\nElif: 这因人而异，但我觉得耐心、文化开放与尊重、韧性和适应能力非常重要。初到一个陌生国家可能非常困难。语言障碍、文化冲击、心理健康和社交孤立是主要挑战。经历这些挑战后，最重要的是保持良好的心理状态并学会当地语言，其他困难就会相对容易应对。\r\n莫笔记：我的答案是主动。绝大部分困难是通过主动可以解决的。对我而言最需要克服的困难是不想上班哈哈哈，而想要获得永居或者护照则必须有工作合同(当然伴侣签也可以，但是和人成为伴侣，那比上班更可怕）\r\n12. 你有感受过极度崩溃、疲惫或绝望的时刻吗？你是如何让自己走出那种状态的？\r\nElif: 当然有。我经历过哭泣、精神崩溃的日子。我在难民营住了 2 年半，之前说过，营地条件还可以。但我们和不同国籍的人住在同一屋檐下（私密空间和个人空间很少），这可能是人能经历的非常艰难的事情。我因为这种没有缝隙的共居生活甚至变得有点种族偏见，但我没有不尊重任何人，只是产生了一些负面情绪。我认为公共场所应保持清洁，这是社会公德。但有些人做不到，比如做饭后不收拾、厕所不卫生。我当时做营地的志愿者负责厨房和清洁，每天厨房的情况让我非常沮丧。和工作人员沟通无果后，我感到压抑、挫败和伤心，因为这只是融入社会的一小部分。后来我意识到没人会改变，于是我找了工作，每天在外面工作 8-9 小时，同时学荷兰语，保持忙碌让我走出低谷。同时我当时还遇到了前男友，大部分时间和他在一起。\r\n莫笔记：“自己的房间”真的是人能保持平静和欢愉非常重要的事情，无所不在的集体生活很容易把人逼疯。人需要个体生活，把自己从无所不在的集体的中抽身出来。之前我合租的室友绝大部分都是女性，感受都很不错，但是现在我合租的男性室友总在房子里抽烟抽大麻，都让我很抓狂。而且我从女性那里承租的房子总是很干净，从男性手里承租的房子都脏到不可忍受。所以我现在有性别“偏见，甚至我觉得自己持有的都不是偏见，而是事实：在维持干净卫生层面，绝大多数男性差女性太多，我也相信如果有统计学研究，这个结论会被认证为有“显著差异signifcant difference”.\r\n13. 如果你可以让这个世界上消失一件事，你希望是什么？\r\nElif: 我希望消除不平等，因为这个世界非常不平等。本质上人类都是同一种族，但享有的权利多或少不一。\r\n莫笔记：答案答案同上。\r\n14. 你最希望发生什么事？对你自己和这个世界来说，如果它发生了，会变得更好？\r\nElif: 这个问题有点难回答，我会说希望平等和正义得到实现，因为并非每个人都能享有这些。我会再仔细思考。\r\n莫笔记：我会希望每个国家的领导人都是女性，这样战争会更少发生，平等和正义实现的可能性更高。\r\n15. 你原来国家的家人和朋友现在过得怎么样？\r\nElif: 家人和朋友在土耳其过得还好。我时不时会和他们联系。有些朋友来过荷兰，我们度过了愉快的时光。我的一个朋友可能今年或明年会来，我很想见他。他要结婚了，我很遗憾不能去参加婚礼。\r\n莫笔记：我去年去了伊斯坦布尔，我发现这是全世界城市中人类最热情友好的地方之一。当然它的男性凝视和二手烟的情况也不容忽视。\r\n16. 对于其他考虑离开国家或者已经经历相似旅程的人，你有什么建议？\r\n我Elif: 建议大家要有耐心，尽管有时很困难。我自己一开始也不太耐心，但慢慢学会了，明白了等待美好事物的价值。其次，要保持开放心态。这对年长或宗教上特别虔诚的人可能比较难，但我们需要学会在不失去自我文化的前提下适应新的文化。\r\n莫笔记：我非常喜欢elif这句“等待美好事物的价值”，很多时候好事情就是会慢慢到来的，就像很多时候人们把取得一个国家的永居或者国籍的过程叫做“移民监”，等待的时间被称作是蹲监狱。我有时候被签证困扰也不免这么觉得，但是也会转念一想：我怎么能把自己每一天的日子定义为“监狱”呢，这实在是对不起自己。我也停止想象“等我拿到了护照我将更自由更幸福”，我尽量让自己当下的每一天都幸福和自由。我不把任何一天当做是次等的。\r\n17. 你现在觉得自己真正属于这里吗？什么样的地方会让你觉得这是“家”？\r\nElif: 不，我不觉得自己真正属于这里，也不认为将来会有这种感觉。我在土耳其时也没有这种归属感。我觉得有朋友、真诚的朋友、慷慨的环境会让我感到像家，但在荷兰这很难找到。\r\n莫笔记：ELif的话让我想起了伍尔夫的那句“As a woman, I have no country”，女性在任何地方想找到真正的归属感都是很难的。这个世界很多地方都只是男性的家。其实我来到荷兰的第一周，我就非常惊异地发现，我在精神层面没有什么需要调整和适应的，我有一种如鱼得水的感觉。我现在想想，对我而言，让我感受到自由的地方就是我的家。自由，自然，自在的地方都可以是我的家，理想的家。\r\n18. 你怎么看自己五年后的生活？想留在荷兰，回到原来的国家，还是去别的地方？\r\nElif：五年后我可能还会在荷兰，做自己想做的工作，过得很开心。但之后我真的想搬到一个更温暖的国家，比如西班牙。我也想远程工作。我喜欢西班牙的文化，等我的荷兰语水平够好后，也很想学西班牙语。\r\nEcho’s note： 我也希望秋冬可以住在西班牙，而春夏则住在荷兰，因为西班牙那时候太热了！西班牙和荷兰交替生活会是最理想的状态。\r\n19. 离开原来的国家，来到另一个国家开始新生活，这段经历改变了你吗？你还是以前的你吗？\r\nElif：这段经历说实话很艰难，尤其是第一年。不过我和人沟通倒没什么问题，我的英语不错，这方面比较容易（Elif之前在土耳其就是英语专业的）。后来我开始学荷兰语，这让生活更顺利。我成长了非常多，也更加相信自己，思维模式也更加“荷兰式”。我很快就适应了这里。现在就是如鱼得水的状态，一切都感觉容易多了。\r\n其实刚在难民营的时候，当我在外面遇到新朋友时，我会很羞于说自己是“难民。\r\nEcho’s note： 我非常能体会Elif提到的那种羞耻感。有时候你的背景或处境会让你觉得自己低人一等，应该为此觉得羞耻，就像我刚从皖北农村来到北京上学时，我的一位学姐偷偷和我说：不要在北京说老家的土话，说普通话。我感觉我当时的脸都因为这句话烧了很久。\r\n这这些羞耻的感受，需要经过很多学习、游荡、创造，反思，才能从生理和心理上全然地摒除，充分意识到这种羞耻感是被社会构建的，毫无必要且相当不合理。我很高兴 Elif——也包括我自己——已经越过了这个部分。\r\n以及我的变化呢，我简直再造重生了自己。不仅仅靠在荷兰，还靠我在全世界各地的游荡和创造，当然这一切都是从我有勇气逃离，来到荷兰开始的。\r\n20. 最近是什么让你感到希望？是什么帮助你坚持下去？\r\nElif：我的抱负野心和对未来的希望给了我希望。我知道只要主动努力学习汲取、投入时间和精力，我就总能实现自己想要的。我想要美好的生活和未来，所以我会竭尽全力去实现它。\r\nEcho’s note： 这个回答翻译成中文可能有些许的鸡汤，但是我看到elif给我发的原文时非常感动和受到激励。就是你知道一个女性经历了什么，破除了什么，才能对自己有这样的笃信和希望。\r\n什么是幸福的前提呢？抱负、渴望、自信以及对未来的想象力。\r\nEchoing the World – Interview with Elif\r\n1. When did you come to the Netherlands?\r\nElif: I came to the Netherlands on the 30th of August 2022. Well actually I came here earlier, at the beginning of August, but I sought asylum at the end of the month.\r\nEcho's note: I arrived in the Netherlands at the end of August 2021, exactly one year before Elif. Now it’s August 2025. August is the last beautiful month of the year in the Netherlands; after that, the wind and rain gradually arrive, the days get shorter, temperatures drop, and nights come earlier.\r\n2. Why did you feel that you had to leave your country at that time? What made it impossible or unsafe for you to stay?\r\nElif: There’s a political problem between Erdogan and Gulen. Erdogan is the president of Turkey and Gulen was a religious leader for his followers. His movement’s goal is to spread love, peace and give more importance to religion, nice manners, and education. In 2016, there was a coup attempt and Erdogan blamed Gulen and his followers for the coup and started arresting everyone who supported Gulen. My mom’s friends were taken into custody and imprisoned one by one. That was scary for my mom, so we decided to come to the Netherlands.\r\nEcho's note: I first learned the term “Gülen movement” from Elif. I had wondered before how it was possible to apply for political asylum in the Netherlands when Turkey was not at war. After researching, I learned that the Turkish president defined Gülen and his supporters as “terrorists” and arrested many, including ordinary teachers and company employees. It’s common in many countries that those in power arrest people for differing opinions or interests, as seen in the well-known “anti-mafia campaigns” or the less-known 709 arrests in China.\r\n3. Why did you choose the Netherlands? What factors influenced your decision?\r\nElif: We did a lot of research about a few countries such as Finland, France, and the Netherlands. We decided to come here because the asylum procedure was better and human rights are highly valued. That’s why we thought the Netherlands was the best option for us.\r\nEcho's note: This was three years ago in the Netherlands. Last year, the right-wing PVV party came to power, proposing extremely strict policies against refugees and immigrants. Fortunately, this summer, the PVV leader resigned after public opposition to his extreme anti-immigrant proposals. The Netherlands is preparing for a new election, and I saw today that he is running again with a platform to completely stop accepting refugees. In the global wave of rightward politics, obtaining political asylum becomes increasingly difficult. However, endless wars and political conflicts are continually creating more refugees.\r\n4. How did you get to the Netherlands in the end? Was the journey difficult or complicated? How long did it take, and how much did it cost?\r\nElif: We came to the Netherlands legally, by plane with our Turkish passports. We didn’t need a visa because my mom and I had a special “green passport,” which government employees can get after starting work for the government. First, we flew to France and then came to the Netherlands by car. I honestly don’t remember how much it cost.\r\nEcho's note: A good passport and driving skills are extremely important for women wandering the world!\r\n5. What was your first month in the Netherlands like? Was the asylum process smooth? Did you have to stay in a refugee center?\r\nElif: My first month was horrible. Ter Apel and other refugee camps were very full. We were scared we might have to stay outside for a few days. Luckily, we didn’t. The camp staff accommodated women, children, and families, providing food and beds, but single men often had to stay outside. We stayed at Ter Apel for three days, which was horrible. Then we were sent to an emergency shelter in Exloo, a small village about 30–40 minutes away. The shelter was a converted school gymnasium, housing 70–100 people with no privacy. We stayed there a week with breakfast and dinner provided. Hearing people speak Dutch there, I thought the language would be very difficult to learn 😭. Later, we moved to Oss for 2.5 years. At first, we stayed in a school for 3–5 months, then moved to prefabricated rooms. Oss was a relatively nice refugee camp with many activities and volunteering opportunities. This is how I started learning Dutch.\r\nEcho's note: Ter Apel is a large village in the northeast of the Netherlands, near Germany. Many refugees seeking political asylum are temporarily placed there. I mapped Elif’s movements in the Netherlands over three years—from the north to the south, crossing most of the country.\r\n6. Do you still feel the same way about the Netherlands as you did in the first month? What has changed?\r\nElif: In the first months, I thought the Netherlands was better. Now everything has become more expensive. I still don’t like the rain 😭. There’s a saying: “You’re not made of sugar,” meaning you won’t melt in the rain. But I think I’d melt haha. I still think the Netherlands is beautiful.\r\nEcho's note: Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the overall cost of living in the Netherlands has risen, and attitudes toward refugees and immigrants have changed. For refugees and immigrants, the Netherlands is not as good as it was a few years ago. Of course, the same applies globally.\r\nIn my new Dutch class today, I shared Elif’s proverb about not being sugar with a classmate from Chile. She said she feels like sugar that would melt in the Dutch rain. Turkey and Chile both have fewer rainy days than the Netherlands. Recently, due to climate change, rainy places like the Netherlands and London have seen very little rain in the past six months, while dry cities like Beijing have turned humid, like tropical rainforests. Sometimes climate change has a stronger impact than human migration.\r\n7. So far, do you enjoy living in the Netherlands? What do you like and what do you dislike about it?\r\nElif: I do enjoy living here. I love partying and going to festivals—the Netherlands is the best country for fun. Dutch people really know how to enjoy life. But every city is similar: church, canals, same architecture. It gets a bit boring. I also dislike the transportation system—it’s terrible, expensive, and trains are often delayed when it rains, which I find strange.\r\nEcho's note: I previously lived in Rotterdam for three years—a post-WWII newly built city, very different from other Dutch cities. The place I lived resembled Manhattan in New York. But Dutch public transport is really expensive, even more than Zurich, one of the most expensive European cities. Many people commute by train; round-trip costs are 20–40 euros, while in Zurich, 10 CHF tickets allow unlimited rides for 24 hours and even boat rides. Crazy!\r\n8. If you could go back to the moment you made the decision, would you still choose the Netherlands? Or would you consider another country? Why?\r\nElif: That’s a good question. I’m not sure how to respond, but I’d still choose the Netherlands because it’s prosperous and freer compared to other countries.\r\nEcho's note: After wandering through most of Europe and the world, I still believe that choosing the Netherlands back then was the wisest decision.\r\n9. If you could switch lives with anyone, who would it be?\r\nElif: Can I say a Dutch person? Not a specific individual, but I’d like to live like a Dutch person—speak the language freely and do what I want.\r\nEcho's note: My top four preferences: Dutch, Parisian, Zurich, or New Yorker. Any one of these would be perfect.\r\n10. What do you think it means for someone to leave their homeland? Is it a good thing or a bad thing? Why?\r\nElif: It’s both good and bad. Most people leave their country because they don’t feel safe and want a better life. Leaving everything is hard, but with hope and doing your best, you can achieve a better life.\r\nEcho's note: For women, leaving one’s hometown is eternally a good thing. Challenges are many, but self-liberation cannot happen if one stays in place.\r\n11. What qualities are most important when someone leaves their home country to start a new life elsewhere? What are the biggest challenges to overcome?\r\nElif: It depends on the person. Patience, cultural openness, respect, resilience, and adaptability are important. Language barriers, cultural shock, mental health, and social isolation are major challenges. Maintaining good mental health and learning the local language makes other challenges easier.\r\nEcho's note: For me, proactivity is essential. Most difficulties can be solved actively. The biggest challenge for me is not wanting to work (haha), but to get permanent residence or citizenship, one must have a work contract (or a partner). Becoming a partner is even scarier than working.\r\n12. Have you ever felt completely overwhelmed, exhausted, or hopeless? How did you pull yourself out of that state?\r\nElif: Omg, of course. I know the days when crying, having mental breakdowns. I stayed 2.5 years in a refugee shelter, I’ve talked about it before and it was a nice camp. However, we had to live with different nationalities and that’s a quite difficult situation one can ever live in. And living there made me a bit of racist.. Still I’m not disrespecting anyone but I have some negative feelings. \r\nIf you live in a public place then you should keep it clean in my opinion. That’s a society ethic. However, there were people who wouldnt do that, when they cooked, went to toilet/douche.. And I was doing volunteering and was responsible for the kitchen and cleaning. This situation was pissing me of because how 25-45 year old people cannot clean what they made dirty?!!!? I talked to workers about it, talked to those people but I couldn’t get any results. I was just overwhelmed, frustrated and sad because this is only a small part of integration to society.. I realized that nobody would do anything about it so I found a job and worked almost every day, 8-9 hours, not to go to the shelter and see those people. And I was learning Dutch at the same time. Keeping myself busy pulled me out of that state. Also I met my ex boyfriend and was spending most of my time with him.\r\nEcho's note: Having your own room is extremely important for peace and joy. Life in constant collective spaces can drive people crazy. I’ve lived with mostly female roommates and it was pleasant, but male roommates often smoke or do cannabis indoors, which is maddening. In terms of cleanliness, most men are far less clean than women. These facts make me “sexist”( which i regrad not as prejudice but as truth)\r\n13. If you could make one thing disappear from this world, what would it be?\r\nElif: Inequality, because the world is very unequal. Everyone is of the same race but with more or fewer rights.\r\nEcho's note: Same as above!\r\n14. What is something you deeply wish would happen—for yourself and for the world? Something that, if it happened, would make everything better.\r\nElif: Equality and justice, because not everyone can access these.\r\nEcho's note: My answer is similar: I hope all national leaders were women, so there would likely be less war and more equality and justice.\r\n15. How are your family and friends doing back in your home country?\r\nElif: My family and friends are doing fine in Turkey. I talk to them occasionally. Some visited, which was nice. One friend plans to come this year or next. I’m sad I can’t attend his wedding.\r\nEcho's note: Last year I visited Istanbul, and I found it to be one of the friendliest and most hospitable cities in the world. Of course, male gaze and second-hand smoke remain issues.\r\n16. What advice would you give to others who are considering leaving their country, or who are already going through a similar journey?\r\nElif: Be patient. Good things take time. Also, keep an open mind. Learn to adjust to a new culture without losing yourself or your own culture.\r\nEcho's note: I really like Elif’s phrase, “Good things take time.” Many times, good things do take time to arrive. It reminds me of how people often describe the process of obtaining permanent residence or citizenship as being in an “immigration prison,” with the waiting years compared to serving a sentence. I have sometimes felt this way myself when troubled by visa issues. But then I think: how can I define each day of my life as a “prison”? That would be doing myself an injustice. I’ve also stopped imagining that only when I get a passport will I be freer or happier. Instead, I try to make each day in the present truly happy and free. I refuse to treat any day of my life as second-class.\r\n17. Do you feel like you truly belong here now? What makes a place feel like home to you?\r\nElif: No, I don’t feel like I truly belong here, and I don’t think I ever will. Having sincere friends and being in a generous environment would feel like home, which is hard to find in the Netherlands.\r\nEcho's note: Elif’s words remind me of Woolf’s quote: “As a woman, I have no country.” For women, it is hard to find true belonging anywhere. Much of the world is just a man’s home. For me, a place that gives a sense of freedom is home. Freedom, nature, and ease define home.\r\n18. Where do you see yourself in five years? Do you want to stay in the Netherlands, go back to your country, or move somewhere else?\r\nElif: In 5 years I’d be still in the Netherlands, working at job I want and happy but after that I really wanna move to a warm country, could be Spain. And I wanna work remotely. I love Spanish culture and really wanna learn Spanish after achieving a good level of Dutch.\r\nEcho’s note: I also hope I could spend autumn and winter in Spain, but spring and summer in the Netherlands, because it’s so hot in Spain during that time! A mix of Spain and the Netherlands would be perfect.\r\n19. How has this journey—leaving your country and starting over elsewhere—changed you? Are you still the same person you used to be?\r\nElif: The journey was quite hard tbh. Especially the first year. But communication wasnt a problem at all, I speak English and it was easy. Then I started to learn Dutch, which made my journey easier. I improved a lot, I’m more confident, can think things like Dutch people. I get used to here quickly. Now that we’re at home, it’s easier to live and get used to live. It was quite hard when we were at the refugee camp. I was ashamed of saying that I’m a refugee actually when I meet new people.\r\nEcho’s note: I really relate to the sense of shame she mentions. Sometimes your background or situation can make you feel inferior. It takes a lot of study, wandering, reflection, and thinking to build up confidence and realize that this sense of shame isn’t necessary. I’m happy that Elif—and we—have worked through this.\r\n20. What gives you hope these days? What helps you keep going?\r\nElif: My ambition and hopes in the future gives me hope. I know that I can achieve what I want if I study and do a lot. I want a good life and future so I’m doing everything to make it happen.\r\nEcho’s note: I am really inspired by this answer. What are the preconditions for happiness? Ambition, desire, confidence, and imagination about the future—these seem to be what keep us going and believing that we can shape our lives.\r\n倘若你有关于“莫问世界Echoing the World”任何感受，问题和建议（比如希望我去采访谁），欢迎在评论区留言！\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.INC0FQk2dcCuNiSCsd5OuAfRu0hZW1IfywcDZ-dY-jU?\r\n",

      "body": "View this post on the web at https://post.substack.com/p/the-tulpa-of-the-internet\r\n\r\nEditor’s note: In the interest of documenting the most curious corners of our digital culture, we present this analysis of a man who, recently, has mastered the art of asking famous people for energy drinks.\r\nThis summer, one star in the crowded firmament of the internet has shone more brightly for me than any other: donald boat . I don’t know who he is and I don’t really want to know; I don’t know where he came from either, and it seems not only beside but perhaps detrimental to the point, if there is one. All I know about Mr. Boat is that he is extremely talented at a particular kind of posting, so good that he has posted his way to (minor) fame and (relative) fortune.\r\nHe’s summarized his own arc here [ https://substack.com/redirect/2c00430b-fd54-45d2-a258-33dd83dd5d8b?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], but to compress it for this report: Mr. Boat replies to famous people on X demanding that they buy him things—expensive video game equipment, books, energy drinks—and they do.\r\nAnalyzing humor is famously futile, but Donald Boat exemplifies certain aesthetic, and even moral, dynamics that any student of the present—and any future historian worth a damn—will want to understand. He is a better key to a dimension of American online culture than any longform post about a “vibe shift” would be. And he demonstrates just how close that culture is to real power: Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, for example, but many, many others. To paraphrase the Stranger in The Big Lebowski: “Sometimes there’s a man—and I’m talking about [Donald Boat] here—sometimes there’s a man, well, he’s the man for his time and place. He fits right in there.” Learning about such a man can tell you a lot about his time and place.\r\nSo what might we learn? The salient starting point is that something in his posting appeals so deeply to busy, important people that they pause their lives to indulge him. How does he post?\r\nHe is chaotic in a way reminiscent of the feed-addled lunatic, sharing wild image collages, but without any of the true lunatic’s frustrated demands to be taken seriously; that is: he’s joking around, playing, but with the elements of the fatally online.\r\nHe’s very funny, in a way that’s referential without being obviously “of a tribe.” He popped when he finally got Altman’s attention with a comment imagining the two of them on the Amalfi coast drinking together and celebrating something Altman, he proposed, should buy him; Altman was persuaded. The combination of literate wit with open grift is novel, and seems to amuse people, I think in part because he makes absolutely no moral claims beyond the obviously comic insistence on the primacy of his own self-interest. Somehow, the entire world of serious internet activity is the butt of this joke.\r\nHis asks are simple and quick. Most solicitations famous people receive are disguised bids for long-term connection, career advancement, or validation. Mr. Boat’s are Amazon links.\r\nThey are also fundamentally low-status, which is related. He does not seem to be trying to “associate with” any of these extremely famous people; he does not frame his requests as serving some greater good, or as justified by some prior injustice. It’s fairly uncommon for people to demand goods that serve no end but their own pleasure. Mr. Boat has the advantage once held by panhandlers with signs saying “I just want beer”: refreshing honesty.\r\nWhen Mr. Boat turns to books, his requests are esoteric; he wants to learn about the Desert Fathers, for example, or about the Dharma. Another unexpected element of his identity: a grifting gamer who wants to get closer to God.\r\nIf there is indeed “a man for [this] particular time and place,” the Silicon Valley–adjacent anon-driven algorithmic feed of the day, he is a casually schizoid spiritualist relaxed about his autodidactic depth, totally post-status and post-achievement, a slacker demanding favors from some of the most successful people in the world. And of course, he makes it all fun. Fun to watch, fun to join in, and probably fun for benefactors, who could feel like they were underwriting a popularly pleasing internet divertissement, which they were. Fun can be a somewhat controversial thing on timelines, which makes Mr. Boat a bit of a tonal revolutionary.\r\nI’m not alone in seeing myself in Mr. Boat. My friend David Cole remarked that we had so much overlap with this possibly prayerful, meditating, energy-drink-guzzling video game freak that he might as well be our tulpa. Or perhaps we are his: the two of us, and surely many others, only the “thought-forms” or manifestations of his spirit. If so, we are grateful to him for calling us into existence.\r\nIt’s this fusion of mysticism with celebrity that makes Donald Boat singular. He is an avatar for obscure parts of the internet, and he offered big accounts a way to engage with them while amusing a broader audience. Significant wisdom and subtlety are involved in this, and the results are undeniable: many love it all, the way they might enjoy seeing a jester get one over on the royal court while simultaneously entertaining it. And like the best jesters, Mr. Boat secures real rewards for himself in the process.\r\nA good time was had by all, excluding anyone he texted who just couldn’t get hip to the scene. (We do not know how, for example, Kylie Jenner or Beto O’Rourke felt, but one imagines the occasional noble who just couldn’t summon the right mood in such a moment.) We should have compassion for them; they missed the Boat.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.0NvgDgJlHen5qcn9VL9vzmFnwgmqrfnkK7m0UWph8XQ?",

They Didn't Have To Come To Epstein For That.”\r\nLast week, the DOJ released six hours of audio from the interview deputy attorney general Todd Blanche conducted with Ghislaine Maxwell in Florida at the end of July. Days later, she was relocated from FCI Tallahassee, a low-security federal prison for women in Florida, to the Federal Prison Camp Bryan, Texas—a minimum-security prison camp.\r\nI spent last weekend and much of this week listening and extracting the most revealing and curious excerpts. Blanche was motivated in his questioning by his own objectives, but as he sought to get Maxwell on the record about the topics he wanted to cover, he uncovered much more, though you would never know it based on coverage from most mainstream media sources. Among the strangest aspects of the DOJ tapes of Blanche and Maxwell is that they are almost hiding in plain sight. Most coverage has focused on her plea for a pardon and her praise for the president. Almost no coverage reflected any real effort to listen to what she had to say, or to make sense of it, or to take her seriously at all.\r\nMaxwell emphasized that the interview with Blanche, three years into her incarceration, was the first time anyone from the government had asked her anything at all. The meeting came at her request. Her recollections sketch a surreal map of global power networks, a goldmine of gossip and intrigue with implications that span the highest levels of governments, monarchies, business, and elite society. Anyone pretending not to know her is exposed.\r\nMaxwell dished on Epstein’s erectile dysfunction, her suspicion that he never loved her, Fergie’s crush on him, Diana supposedly set up with him. She insinuated there was more to the relationship between Epstein and Lex Wexner, a major point of interest in various theories and conspiracies. She denied hiring underage women and observed how #MeToo warped ideas around burdens of proof and guilt and innocence. She described the women around Epstein as pleased to be with him. At turns, she defended him, but she condemned him, too. She described his perversions as a “slide,” a progression from which the man she first met became the man condemned by the world and the justice system as a predator. Still, she insisted he was not “creepy” in a way that rose to the level of criminality. She complimented his business acumen and intellect. It was complicated, is what it sounded like. It was a real relationship.\r\nAfter three years studying Maxwell, trying to understand the woman she was before Epstein and who she is in his absence, the interview affirmed my view of her as a figure shaped by layered, generational trauma—imperceptible to those who looked at her and saw just a privileged high society heiress engulfed in scandal—and almost fated for downfall once seduced by a manipulative man.\r\nIn the interview, Maxwell was candid, captivating, and as charming as we had been warned. She made clear that she once deeply loved Epstein. She had wanted to marry him and imagined a family with him—a dream he encouraged enough to string her along but never intended to fulfill. Her choices are not relatable to most. But do you have to personally relate to someone in order to understand them? I don’t think so. To me, her story reveals how grossly the media misrepresents people once they are turned into characters, how easily a person flattened in this manner becomes a villain, and how important it is to consult source material when forming your opinions about anyone involved in alleged crimes or confirmed scandals. Especially on this scale. The media narratives are designed to be consumed fast and sustained easily. Nuance is harder to cram into a headline or a viral takedown. Complication takes time to fully appreciate. When we decline to assess anything with that kind of care, we don’t just do a disservice to the people involved in the story, but to ourselves, because we are robbed of a more accurate understanding of our complicated world.\r\nAs Epstein’s understudy, Maxwell was rarely afforded nuanced analysis. In documentaries and articles, familiar sources paint her as a money-hungry femme fatale, a cold and narcissistic figure incapable of love, or a calculating socialite who squandered an Oxford education to serve as fixer for a predatory man—one who promised the fortune and status she lost when her father’s crimes erased her inheritance. After his death, Maxwell worked relentlessly. She launched several ventures and managed all of Epstein’s estates. At her trial, jurors saw the meticulous house manuals she drafted—evidence of her remarkable skill at management. Her own words about her experience function as a kind of psychological x-ray, revealing a woman who lived multiple lives, seduced entire cultural spheres, and replayed the patterns of her family history.\r\nThrough his questions and approach, Blanche revealed himself and the DOJ, too. He treated the interrogation like a tea party—albeit one hosted by a cautious, stale lawyer. He displayed a total lack of curiosity and insufficient knowledge on the subject matter. He fumbled questions and failed to follow up on details about which Maxwell clearly wanted to expand. For instance, she mentioned three times a sexual condition that limited “a lot of intercourse,” and he never asked for more information. She insisted her father did not work for the Mossad and had never met Epstein, a counter to the accusations of blackmail, yet she said she believes Epstein was murdered. By who? We don’t know. Blanche asked but Maxwell did not name any direct suspects. He could have pressed this harder. Blanche also struggled to understand why she was valuable to Bill Clinton. It took her finally stating that Clinton “really liked” her before he registered the obvious implication. They were involved sexually. Her “value” varied.  \r\nIf the DOJ had wanted to conduct a more productive interview with Maxwell, they should have sent a woman. Instead, Blanche’s performance communicates that his objectives were not to obtain more information in the public interest but to absolve Donald Trump and anyone connected to his administration. \r\nOn the subject of Trump, Maxwell said she admired his extraordinary achievement in becoming president. She liked him and has always liked him. Her father loved him.\r\n“I never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way. The President was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects,” she stated. \r\nAfter Maxwell’s arrest in 2020, Trump was asked if he expected her to make public the identifies of men accused of wrongdoing in connection to the crimes alleged against her and Epstein, who had died the year prior while incarcerated. “I don’t know,” he said. “I haven’t really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly.” He added, “I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach… But I wish her well, whatever it is.”\r\nEpstein Tapes: “I Was Donald Trump’s Closest Friend”\r\nIn 2002, Trump told New York Magazine that Epstein was a “terrific guy.” By 2019, their fates had taken wildly different trajectories: Epstein was in jail and Trump was in the White House. The president downplayed their association. He knew him, he said, “like everybody in Palm Beach knew him.” He added, “I had a falling-out with him. I haven’t spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you.” The following month, Epstein was dead.\r\nIn late July, Trump told reporters at the White House that he had not considered a pardon for Maxwell. “I’m allowed to do it, but it’s something I have not thought about,” he said.\r\nA few days later, he was pressed on the issue again. “Well, I’m allowed to give her a pardon, but nobody’s approached me with it,” he said. “Right now, though, it would be inappropriate to talk about it.”\r\nStill, sources close to the matter suggest that some kind of deal may already be in place.\r\nBefore his death, Robert Maxwell had hoped his youngest daughter would marry into another powerful family, strengthening the Maxwell brand. He reportedly had his eye on a Kennedy match. According to tabloid records, Ghislaine tried.\r\nIn the audio, she disclosed close relationships with several members of the Kennedy family. She laughed, subtly confirming a rumored fling with JFK Jr. Blanche was not very interested. Sticking to precise questions, he made it clear he aimed to also absolve Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and in that way, further protect the administration in which he serves as a cabinet secretary. Had Blanche been more knowledgeable, he might have done a better job. Instead, he led Maxwell to reveal information that contradicted what RFK has said in the past. \r\nOver the past year, RFK Jr. has made inconsistent claims about his association with Epstein and Maxwell, but he has always attributed any connection to his wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy, who died in 2012.\r\n“My wife had some kind of relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell,” he told Fox News in 2023. But Maxwell was already enmeshed with the Kennedy family before that marriage. She attended Kerry Kennedy’s 1990 wedding to Andrew Cuomo, and in my conversations with sources familiar with the family, Maxwell was described as a frequent presence around RFK Jr. and Mary. Like Ivana and Donald Trump, both appeared in Epstein’s Rolodex. The Clintons, curiously, did not.\r\nWhen I asked about his connection to Maxwell, Bobby told me the same story he shared later on a podcast. He first claimed, in a 2023 interview with Newsweek, to have flown on Epstein’s plane once. Then he amended that claim a month later, saying he had flown on Epstein’s plane twice. Both trips—one to South Dakota and one to Florida—were taken with his wife and children, he has insisted, and he never flew with Epstein alone. In his telling, he first spoke to Epstein on one of these flights, and he became suspicious about how a math teacher became so well connected and so wealthy. Yet he has also claimed that one of these flights took place in 1993, when he was still married to his first wife, Emily Ruth Black, and that four of his children were onboard, though his fourth child was not born until 1995.\r\nIt was also in 1993 that Epstein gave RFK Jr. access to his Madison Avenue office. According to the New York Post, citing family friend Christina Oxenberg, when RFK Jr. enlisted her to help produce a charity event, he told her, “‘I already borrowed an office for you to work from.’” The office was a shared workspace, and Epstein and Maxwell were often there, according to Oxenberg. In her telling, it was RFK Jr., not his wife, who received the invitation to fly to South Dakota. “Maxwell told Oxenberg that she had arranged for Kennedy to take a ride in Epstein’s private jet. ‘Ghislaine made a point of telling me she had arranged to take Bobby Kennedy Jr. on a day trip in the plane,’” said the New York Post.\r\nMaxwell resurfaced in the Kennedy orbit years later. She was photographed at Mary Richardson Kennedy’s 2012 memorial hosted by the Kennedys, though not at the separate service held by Mary’s family. Two years later, in 2014, RFK Jr. was photographed at Maxwell’s NYC home for a fundraiser.\r\n“Some kind of relationship”—the phrase implies almost total unfamiliarity, as if they were barely friends at all, and not close enough for RFK Jr. to know much about Maxwell or Epstein. Yet the facts suggest otherwise.\r\nMaxwell told Blanche about her relationships with other powerful men who later tried to erase her from their stories. I was told that Ted Waitt even hired an Israeli firm to scrub photos of him with her in the weeks before her arrest. She mentioned her ties to the Cuomo brothers and recalled hosting a birthday party for Sergey Brin, with Elon Musk among the guests. She spoke of Musk as a familiar connection rather than a passing acquaintance, as he has stated.\r\nHer reflections reveal not just proximity to power but the gravitational pull she exerted across politics, technology, and culture.\r\nListening to the DOJ tapes, I came away thinking that Maxwell was less an accessory to Epstein than a reflection of the world she inhabited, with all its hungers, hypocrisies, and compulsions.\r\nIn my opinion, the interview is a lens through which we can examine that world, which, like it or not, shapes our culture and government in ways both unseen and overt. All of that is there to hear in Maxwell’s own words. To anyone willing to listen.\r\nRobert Maxwell On Donald Trump \r\n“I may have met Donald Trump at that time, because my father was friendly with him and liked him very much. And I think, should be said that he also very much liked Ivana, because she was also from Czechoslovakia where my dad was from.”\r\nBLANCHE: Whatever money or whatever equity was in the businesses, just stayed with your other family members?\r\nMAXWELL: No, there was no money. So my father was never attached to money. He was born a peasant, a real one. Dirt floor, no shoes, no clothes -- some clothes, but not, you know, sorry, I don't mean to say -- nothing. And he never -- he was never into that. I mean, there were things that he had his extravagances, he loved his boat and his plane. So obviously you need money for that. But there was no, nothing else. And there was not a single penny that came to any of us, at any time, ever.\r\nRobert Maxwell As Intelligence \r\nMaxwell: And then the debacle of my father's passing hit the family. And -- and we lost all our businesses and my family thought that it would be best if I stayed in America, because of the intensity of the press and the drama surrounding my father's death in England. So I stayed and Epstein said, well, you can keep helping me. You can help me find a house and we can decorate the house. And it gave me something to do.\r\nTodd Blanche: Were you in a romantic relationship with him at this point, or just friends?\r\nMaxwell: No, just friends.\r\nBLANCHE: And with respect to your father, there have been multiple questions about whether he worked for any intelligence agency. Do you have any knowledge about that?\r\nMAXWELL: I think—well, certainly my father had a background in intelligence during the Second World War. He was a British intelligence officer. My belief is that once you’ve been an intelligence officer, you’re kind of always one; it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re formally employed. I don’t think my dad, in any formal sense, was employed by any agency. But when you are a very significant businessman and politician, as my father was, you meet people over time, and you trade business or ideas. If that would fall under that definition, that’s how I would describe it.\r\nOn Robert Maxwell Meeting Epstein \r\nMAXWELL: I know they never met.\r\nBLANCHE: Well, how do you know they never met?\r\n MAXWELL: They — just categorically know they never met. Well, because after, in 1991, before my father died, he asked me if I'd met anybody interesting or whatever, you know, because I was still trying not to be sucked back into the family business. And I told him that I had met Mr. Epstein. And the reason why I shared that I'd met Mr. Epstein, because I believed, at that time, that Epstein worked for Bear Stearns. And Bear Stearns was one of our banks. And I knew that my father was friendly with both Jimmy Cayne and with Ace Greenberg. So my dad came -- was actually in New York, I think. If I remem- -- I may -- I don't think I had this conversation on the phone, but I --I honestly we're talking 30 years ago, so I'm not sure. But if I -- I maybe I told him this verbatim, because it happened -- I know that what my dad did, whether I saw it or whether I -- he did it and told me later I -- that I don't remember. But he called both Jimmy Cayne and Ace Greenberg to ask if -- what sort of guy he was and was he even allowed to -- because (indiscernible) so . . .\r\nBLANCHE: So they never -- they never met.\r\nMAXWELL: He didn't even know who he was.”\r\nGhislaine’s First Impression of Epstein\r\nMAXWELL:  I — he just invited me to come and have tea, and I was like tea, that's English. Okay. But what was unusual, was in his offices. So I went to his offices and we met. And I found him very engaging and that was that.\r\nMaxwell’s Salary \r\nMAXWELL: And I didn't know that he had any money. It was like, I want to say it was $12,000 a month, which to me seemed like a fortune. And I said to myself, I found this house, but I don't think you can afford it. He was like, that's ridiculous. Of course I can afford, and he rented it. And that house came with -- it was a State Department house, because it was -- I think that was under sequestration or whatever it was. And I -- I put it back together, but there were certain rules, you couldn't paint, because it had to go back and he gave it back to the country.\r\nSo he had this house and I had moved into a 10 foot by 10 foot apartment, because all of our stuff had been either lost or frozen or -- or whatever. So he became, in this moment, my life line, really, because I was -- everything was --felt very similar to this moment, if that makes sense.\r\nOn Epstein’s Heart Condition \r\nBLANCHE: A heart condition? Okay.\r\nMAXWELL: Which meant that he didn't have intercourse a lot, which suited me fine, because I actually do have a medical condition, which precludes me having a lot of intercourse.\r\n BLANCHE: So what -- what was your understanding of his heart condition and why that prevented him from having intercourse regularly?\r\n MAXWELL: I don't know. I mean, he liked other forms of sexual activities.\r\nLeaked emails show Epstein’s attempts to dabble in security tech—across borders—in the last years of his life.\r\nInside Jeffrey Epstein's Spy Industry Connections [ https://substack.com/redirect/ddf2ccd6-43f3-4874-bd34-f0ededaba7f6?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\n“The emails below, which have not been published elsewhere, paint a picture of Epstein as a man very eager to be at the nexus between private money and public surveillance. While they were hammering out the Reporty investment, Epstein invited Barak to come to a meeting with Thiel, cofounder of PayPal and the surveillance contractor Palantir, in May 2014. Although Barak couldn't make that meeting, Epstein insisted that Barak \"spend real time with peter thiel [sic]\" and offered to set up a dinner the following month.”\r\nZorro Ranch \r\nMAXWELL: So the ranch was very challenging, because not only that, but it had BLM land, so to help maintain your BLM, you have to have cattle and I love animals. And so the first thing, horses. And so I wanted it, if you're going to have a ranch, I like authenticity. And so I don't think you should have a ranch if you're not going to have the things that make it special.\r\n9/11 Changed Everything \r\nMAXWELL: Other girlfriends. I definitively knew that it was over after 9/11, actually, because we were both in New York and I don't know, were you in New York on 9/11? I mean, 9/11 ...And it was a scary time if you were in New York. You didn't know, I didn't know, nobody knew what was going on. And he was in 71st Street and I was in 65th Street, my house. And he wouldn't see me at all. Asked me, his mum, who I'm very close to, who's in hospital at Lennox Hill, just asked me to look after her. And then I knew, as anyone did at that time, if you're not going to be there for someone in 9/11, you're never going to be there. So for me, that was the line's end. And he had another English girlfriend actually, from 2000.\r\nBLANCHE: Okay. So — so go ahead. So what — what — at that point, when you say you realized kind of it was over?\r\nMAXWELL: Well, I mean, I'm talking about the — the — I had had, there was a —I had wanted to get married and have children.\r\nAnd Epstein had encouraged me to believe that that would -- I don't know about the --certainly by the mid late '90s, I knew the marriage part was never going to happen. I had believed that maybe in '96, '97, '98 maybe, but then I realized it wasn't that. But I did think that we might have a child, which is what I had really wanted. And I realized …\r\nMoving On \r\nMAXWELL: So we stopped having physicality. I mean, that doesn't mean we weren't friends. I certainly did stay, sometimes, in his room. I mean, friends with benefits, if you will, just not sex. Sorry.\r\nAnd I started dating.\r\nAnd I met someone that I fell very much in love with in 2003. His name was Ted Waitt. Ted Waitt, you may know as the founder of Gateway, the computers. And we had an amazing relationship that ended in -- went on until 2010, I think. And I was with Ted from that time.\r\nGM on Epstein: “He was useless at maintaining relationships with people who worked for him, I'm not.”\r\nEpstein’s Email to Maxwell 2015 \r\nBlackmail / Home Surveillance \r\nMAXWELL: So even, let's assume that that premise is correct, that he was doing that and he was going to tell everybody, going to say, \"oh, you know, you had inappropriate relations with an underage girl.\" If you don't have a video or photograph, photographic evidence, because I -- I'm not sure that even the FBI would take that. Well, maybe today, but certainly not back then, would take that seriously. So you have to have something to say, \"Hey, you know, look, I've got this video of you doing terrible things and you need to.\" So I built those houses, many of them. I decorated those houses. I put the electricians in for the wiring. I never wired, nor saw, a single house that had any type of inappropriate, let's say, video surveillance. And I'll define that for you. Inappropriate surveillance would mean in a bathroom, in a bedroom, in any private area of a home.\r\nBut in the criminal case, I received videos of Epstein talking to women and stuff like that. I did get those. I also saw binders, photographs of women and (indiscernible). I never saw any, well, I don't know -- I don't know how old some of these women were. There were definitely some of the victims from Palm Beach, the photographs of them in -- in -- without clothing.\r\nKennedy Connections \r\nRFK On The Epstein Flight \r\nVirginia Giuffre\r\nMAXWELL: And the reason I believe that, so this --she -- she was a self-confessed having been sexually abused as a young girl, and was trained -- her words I'm quoting now, not mine, in all the arts of whatever that is, the sex program by a man called Ron Eppinger, who was her pimp from when she was 14, I believe, or 15, I don't know. And in her book describes him training her to be what every man wants in all its manners, fellatio and everything else. I believe that then what happened was that he met her, and she came as a masseuse to his house, in December of 2001 is when I think it started. Now, what their relationship was or what happened with them in that early period of time, I cannot say. What I can say is that he liked her and she started to travel with him at that time period. I believe -- I know, then, what happened was that she -- when she first started to see him or first came into his orbit as his masseuse or whatever, she was engaged to be married and wearing an engagement ring, and was living with her fiancé? She broke up after a few months, with her fiancé and took up with the local drug dealer. So let's say after four or five months of -- in the time period when she was seeing Epstein, let's say we're now May, June of 2002 or is it 2000. I can't remember. From whenever she hits the -- whatever that is if that's 2000. I think it's 2000. I'm sorry. I think it's when she met him. December of So -- so then you go through -- I don't remember. You'll have to look.\r\nSo then I think -- so she -- she takes up with the local drug dealer and she becomes druggie, druggie. Like, you know, how druggies -- well, maybe you don't. I live with a lot in Tallahassee. They become even more unreliable than normal. And at some point, she's now working somewhere else. He stopped seeing her, because he doesn't like people who do drugs. And I think that not seeing her lasted five or six months. And in that period of time, she got arrested for theft, and she had a warrant out for her arrest. Now, this I've pieced together because this piece I didn't know. She then called Epstein to -- to have help avoiding the warrant for her arrest, and he sent her to Thailand to get a massage therapy license. This is the bit that I guess. This is the bit that I extrapolated. In the period of time from when she came back to when she left, he asked her to replace herself as his masseuse or whatever -- whatever she was doing, and she brought the first replacement for her.\r\nTed Waitt \r\nMAXWELL: So I — I wanted to have a full break when I started dating Ted. And he was clever. I — I — I suppose it would be true to say that I sort of viewed Mr. Epstein, at that point, as sort of family, if you will. Like someone I could rely on. And I should have had more confidence in myself. I can see that now. But at the time, given everything that had happened in my life, I thought that it would -- and I saw how he was with other people like Eva, who seemed to be very comfortable with him, and I thought this would be -- and he always said, I was like family. So he worked hard to make -- maintain a relationship with me. He was generous with me. He Let me use the plane, for instance, which was very generous, he would check in with my mum. He did things that were meaningful to me in that time.\r\nAnd then, it may still not have worked, but that his -- his mother, Paula, had been in a very serious car crash. And I -- she had become sort of like a — a surrogate mother for me, sort of, because my mum wasn't there. I could — I could look after her the way that I would —sorry.\r\nBLANCHE: It's all right.\r\nMAXWELL: The way that I would've liked to look after my own mum. So I became very close to his mother. And she had been in a car crash and in 2004, I believe it -- it may have been 2005, I -- I don't recall exactly. She took a -- her health tooK a serious decline. And Epstein called me and asked me if I could look after her. And by looking after her, that meant organizing her doctors, making sure she had new clothes, making sure her house was clean.\r\nDAVID MARKUS: Where was she?\r\nMAXWELL: She lived in -- in a retirement establishment in -- outside of Palm Beach, outside of -- its West Palm. I want -- I was going to say something like the Golden Girls, but it's not called that. I just don't remember what it's called. But it was an old age -- it was a retirement home, if you will.\r\nLex Wexner  \r\nBLANCHE: Did -- was there -- did --did he give -- did Mr. Wexner gift a property in New York to Mr. Epstein?\r\nMAXWELL: So we're talking about 71st Street. So I don't know what the business deal was, because, again, I'm not part of his business thing, but I think what happened would be that, let's say Les owed him in, theoretically, for his services, $100 million or whatever it was. He could have traded that against the property.\r\nBLANCHE: But do you know that that happened or that's -- are you -- are you kind of --do you remember whether there was conversations about that or are you just thinking that could be one way that it happened?\r\nMAXWELL: I'm not sure. And I'm not trying to be -- I just don't remember if that's something I know or if that's something that I remember, or if it's something that I subsequently know. I believe -- I believe that to be what happened, but I don't want to tell you that I have --\r\nBLANCHE: Yeah.\r\nMAXWELL: Does that make sense?\r\nBLANCHE: Did Mr. Wexner and Mr. Epstein -- are you aware of they -- of their falling out that they ultimately had?\r\nMAXWELL: I think -- I wasn't there and I don't know how it happened. I only know what Les has said in the press.\r\nBLANCHE: So you only know about their, you know, their falling out or whatever you want to call it, from what you've kind of read, not from any firsthand knowledge? You did -- you weren't there, you weren't part of that?\r\nMAXWELL: Correct.\r\nEpstein’s Attention To Detail \r\nBLANCHE: So he would assist his clients, at times, with -- you're saying with even small things like contractual relations with --with --\r\nMAXWELL: He said no detail was too small, because everything that affected how they lived and how they managed their life, was something that he felt he was -- if they want, he would be responsible for, to make sure that the contract -- so that if you had to fire someone, it wouldn't come back and sue you or if that -- that sort of …\r\nAUDIO …\r\n“A Man Wants Sexual Favors, He will Find Them.

Massive increase in demand for AI engineers, with San Francisco’s Bay Area the center of gravity for jobs.\r\nBig Tech hiring stats. Following layoffs in 2022-23, engineering headcount is rising in Big Tech.\r\nGrowing importance of location. Many roles are listed in geographical tech hubs, and engineers are more likely to swap jobs if they live in one.\r\nTenure rising fast at Big Tech. Since 2023, engineers at the biggest places are much less likely to quit, with average tenure being between 4 and 7 years in various Big Tech companies – a dramatic increase!\r\nWhere are Big Tech engineers moving to and from? Big Tech is becoming a pretty closed-loop talent market; most Big Tech hires are from similar-sized places.\r\nEngineering leadership recruitment. Amazon is heavily cutting engineering managers, while most of Big Tech except Apple is reducing Director+ roles.\r\nRemote jobs. The volume of remote roles keeps declining compared to a year ago – except in AI Engineering, where more listings seem to be offering remote work than in recent months.\r\nRelated job market deepdives:\r\nReality of tech interviews in 2025 [ https://substack.com/redirect/2426ade0-c6ea-4dae-9bf5-5560abb19a1e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\nState of the startup and scaleup hiring markets in 2025 – as seen by recruiters [ https://substack.com/redirect/46d45ee3-47e4-47a4-adc8-61b48926f5c0?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\nState of the software engineering job market in 2024 [ https://substack.com/redirect/ba51aa97-d21b-47e4-8646-e3be7d1a6e6a?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\nSurprise uptick in software engineering recruitment [ https://substack.com/redirect/60c09ebb-b834-4cc2-a772-4f07b6ac562b?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (2024)\r\nEnd of 0% interest rates: what the “new normal” means for software engineers [ https://substack.com/redirect/d0c757f0-cfda-447b-8af2-bf3804c8d454?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] (2024)\r\nIn Part 1 of this mini-series we’re going to look into data points from the market.

Tech jobs stats\r\nSlow, steady rise in vacancies\r\nThe good news: the number of software engineering jobs posted by leading tech companies and startups seems to be slowly but surely increasing. Data from TrueUp:\r\nCompanies hiring most\r\nPlaces with the highest number of open positions are mostly Big Tech companies, along with some other publicly traded businesses:\r\nIt’s unsurprising that Apple, Amazon, Oracle, TikTok, NVIDIA, Google, and Microsoft are hiring a lot, but a few names on this list catch the eye:\r\nIBM [ https://substack.com/redirect/0edab188-5290-4e1c-9b00-32b81b772d40?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: one of the oldest tech companies, IBM is alive and kicking, and hiring heavily.

Fun fact: IBM hit an all-time valuation high of $295B this year, and is currently at $225B. This surge suggests business is better than ever.\r\nSpeechify [ https://substack.com/redirect/0517da30-d6d1-4504-a410-6fd2767b4d85?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: a low profile text-to-speech startup that raised $10M and which lists [ https://substack.com/redirect/0517da30-d6d1-4504-a410-6fd2767b4d85?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] 800+ engineering jobs in countries such as the Czech Republic, Romania, Egypt, and Canada. These are the same roles in different countries. This company is hiring heavily for somewhere with relatively little capital raised, which could imply the actual recruitment rate may be lower.\r\nAnduril [ https://substack.com/redirect/ed55455e-62bc-448c-9c9a-4f253d16c4b3?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: hiring around as much as Meta, which is notable. This defense tech startup has landed US government contracts and raised $2.5B.\r\nConsulting companies: Also hiring aggressively are consultancies like NTT Data [ https://substack.com/redirect/9f2509b2-e9d3-4abb-a524-3a5d6bf8312e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] and DXC Technology [ https://substack.com/redirect/add89083-b124-4c45-b3b8-05e2d0f60cf6?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] which offer services and seem to be growing strongly, possibly due to their AI consulting businesses taking off.\r\nSenior-heavy recruitment\r\nSomewhat unexpectedly, there are almost as many open senior positions as there are mid-level and entry-level ones. Usually, far fewer senior roles are advertised.\r\nIt’s also notable how much of a fall there is in vacancies above the senior engineer level. Perhaps this could lead to senior+ engineers applying for slightly more junior roles in the hope of getting uplevelled [ https://substack.com/redirect/b408ee5f-6207-400b-9a2c-021eb80736bf?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] during the interview process.\r\nPublic tech companies have most vacancies\r\nIt’s not even a contest; most jobs listed on TrueUp are at publicly traded tech companies. Trueup scans leading tech companies: Big Tech, publicly traded businesses, and high-profile scaleups and startups. These are places that can pay at the top two tiers of the trimodal compensation model [ https://substack.com/redirect/f7ec6b68-7e08-4888-91f0-2f002a565150?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].\r\n2. AI Engineering trends\r\nAs we’ve covered before, AI Engineering is the hottest segment in tech, and the number of related listings keeps going up:\r\nIt’s easy enough for software engineers to become AI engineers: just build applications on top of LLMs! Recently, we shared seven cases of software developers who have become AI engineers [ https://substack.com/redirect/1618c2eb-a01f-4a7f-ad85-7f8b6e102297?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] by teaching themselves the skills, and this publication advises readers to consider doing the same. From my notes in AI Engineering in the real world [ https://substack.com/redirect/4402d70b-55f1-4d90-96f1-3f9552ceaf94?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]:\r\n“AI engineering is easy enough for software engineers to pick up – and you should. At first, [these people were] hesitant to get involved with building applications on top of LLMs. They knew they did not have the skills, and this new area was not their expertise.\r\nBut it turns out that while “experts” like AI agencies know about more tools, they don’t know more about software engineering than experienced engineers do! The AI agency came up with a horribly overcomplicated architecture, possibly just to use as many cool technologies as they could find.\r\nAI engineering is “just” working with LLMs, and using software engineering concepts. When getting started, LLMs are often behind APIs, and any software engineer can invoke APIs and integrate them into their application. If this API uses LLMs behind the scenes; congratulations, you’re doing “AI engineering”.\r\nSan Francisco still “HQ” of AI Engineering\r\nMost AI engineering jobs are listed for the Bay Area, in the US, and it’s not even close:\r\nThe Bay Area dominates AI Engineering listings. Around 1 in 3 related jobs on TrueUp are based there:\r\nCompanies hiring the most AI Engineers\r\nIf you’re looking for AI Engineering positions, these are the places that pay well and are hiring heavily:\r\nMost common technologies for AI Engineering roles\r\nMost open AI Engineering positions want applicants to be familiar with the AI Engineering stack [ https://substack.com/redirect/e252a0c9-911a-433a-83ea-bfbcb1638265?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], and to be hands-on with building LLM applications. An interesting metric here is the most-mentioned technologies in job adverts:\r\nFor more tips on how to get hired as an AI Engineer, check out the Pragmatic Engineer Podcast episode [ https://substack.com/redirect/8636c197-a393-4163-a452-603468065465?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] I did with Janvi Kalra, an AI Engineer at OpenAI. She had interviews with 46 AI companies, and shares how she moved from software engineer to AI Engineer at Coda, how she prepared for interviews, and researched workplaces.\r\nNo single type of AI Engineering listing\r\nFrom analyzing 200 AI engineering jobs across TrueUp, here’s what I found:\r\nPlatform engineering/product engineering divide. Platform-focused AI engineers build centralized tools and infrastructure to accelerate AI development. These roles often have “AI Platform” in the job description. Meanwhile, product-focused AI engineers work inside product teams and ship AI features for users to utilize. This is pretty much the same platform/product split [ https://substack.com/redirect/0bfa2a9e-17e8-4987-94b1-29c113b8d380?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] as in the rest of software engineering.\r\nLayers of specialization. Many AI engineering jobs are relatively generic, but there are specialized ones like speech roles requiring experience in automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS) ML technologies, and reinforcement learning (RL) focuses.\r\nFoundational model building vs model application. AI engineers who build foundational models are closer to the research side – and these roles are rare. Most jobs expect software engineers to integrate existing models without worrying about how they’re built.\r\nWorking with internal vs external customers. Forward-deployed AI engineers work with external customers, while most roles at TikTok, Google and Amazon are internal-facing. We published a deepdive into forward deployed engineers [ https://substack.com/redirect/047e58a6-0b0d-404d-9a75-281070755f3c?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].\r\nWhere are AI companies hiring from?\r\nThe best way to get into top AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic is to work in Big Tech or at a high-profile AI company:\r\nThis data is pretty sobering; it’s a reminder that it’s easier to get into leading companies if you already work at one. To be fair, this makes sense, as when a company can hire away from Big Tech it usually means they pay the same or better than Big Tech does, and will likely prioritize hiring from such places.\r\nPedigree remains important, and hiring statistics like the chart above speak to the fact that working for a high-profile employer makes it easier to switch to similar companies.\r\n3. Big Tech hiring stats\r\nBig Tech hires engineers again\r\nLet’s start with the good news: Big Tech recruitment has been on the rise in the last 12 months:\r\nNotable Big Tech trends:\r\nMeta: hiring bounces back. After the sharpest cuts in 2023 (down ~-12%), Meta is now hiring the most engineers. The social media giant has 19% more engineers compared to Jan 2022, which is the biggest recovery among Big Tech employers.\r\nGoogle and Apple: steady growth. Compared to 2022, Google’s engineering headcount increased by 16%, and Apple’s by 13%.

[ https://open.substack.com/pub/afterschool2021/p/650?r=pilpv&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false ]》后，这次我来到了英国探索新的打工换宿之旅，去寺庙咖啡馆做Volunteer。这次计划来英国有好几个原因，\r\n首先，我的英国两年旅游签明年3月就要到期了，而我还没有去过英国，在签证剩余有效期不多的时间里，9月可能是英国天气最好最适合游荡的月份。\r\n其次，欧洲飞英国的廉航机票常常便宜的惊人，比如我这次从伦敦飞回西班牙单程只要一两百块人民币，不出门一趟实在说不过去。\r\n最后也很重要的原因是，我需要给自己找点事情做。也是莫不谷此前针对我的情况给的建议，尽量不要自己一个人呆着。我需要给自己找个班上，找点感兴趣，想做的事情做一做，但我也不想真的去上班。打工换宿既能够让我的日常生活建立routine，还可以通过体力活及时得到正反馈，让身体充分调动起来，还不用消耗太多精神和情绪。同时它也提供了低成本游荡的可能，我不需要花很多钱，就可以各处游荡。\r\n所以接下来，我想分享一下这次在英国寺庙咖啡馆打工换宿的经历和体验，我是怎么发现这个项目的？为什么这个项目打动了我？我又是如何成功申请到的？面临语言不通和缺乏经验的限制，我是如何解决这些困难的？以及当我到达打工的寺庙咖啡馆后，又有哪些惊喜，意外和挑战？文章的最后，是我独自一人背包游荡伦敦的故事，还有我接下来计划探索的游荡之旅，这是我第一次来英国，也欢迎大家在评论区给我安利美丽的地方！\r\n本篇内容有点长，可以慢慢阅读，祝大家阅读愉快！\r\n一、我是如何发现英国寺庙咖啡馆义工项目的？\r\n自从我想给自己找点事情做之后，我就经常在网上冲浪，找找打工换宿，遛狗换宿，看家换宿，或者花园换宿的项目，因为在找不到生活意义和动力的当下，我想找一些自己感兴趣，要求不要太高，氛围比较轻松，风景美丽适合游荡的可能。\r\n有一天，我就在小红书看到有个网友分享了她在英国北卡普顿寺庙咖啡馆做义工的经历，立刻被她的故事吸引了，于是利用ChatGPT了解到，Kadampa Meditation Centres （KMC）在英国多个城市招募义工，支持志愿者在咖啡馆打工换宿，还可以免费上冥想课程，心动不如行动，我就立刻对这个项目展开了研究。\r\n二、为什么英国寺庙咖啡馆义工打动了我？\r\n我在网络各种调研，借助ChatGPT工具下申请了Kadampa Meditation Centres (KMC)在莱斯特的World peace cafe咖啡馆志愿者。\r\n我了解了工作情况：每天咖啡馆工作6小时，可以学习做咖啡，做食物，physical work比较多，对体力要求比较高，每周工作30小时，周一周日休息，同时提供免费的吃住（因为是寺庙咖啡馆，只提供素食），也可以免费参加午餐半小时和晚上的冥想课程。\r\n工作内容我感兴趣，工作需求我也能满足，全英文的工作环境可以顺便学习英语，体力活还可以让人动起来保持锻炼，除了可能会累一些似乎没有缺点。\r\n而莱斯特是一个英国中部文化比较多元的小城，距离伦敦只有1小时车程，大巴也只需要2小时，不仅方便到达和离开，还很方便以莱斯特为中心探索周边各个英国城市，充分游荡下英国。\r\n三、我是如何成功申请到英国寺庙咖啡馆义工？\r\n我的背景情况是，没去过英国，既没有流利的英文交流水平，也没有咖啡馆工作经验，唯一与此有关的是去瑞士游荡，在瑞士朋友Ruya开的苏黎世奶茶店体验了一两天，还不会怎么会做好吃的饭，上一次的Newslettter我分享了在荷兰host家里差点把房东厨房烧了的经历。在这个情况下，看起来不太符合对方需要的条件。\r\n但是这些都不重要，重要的是我想申请，我想体验。所以我先思考了自己的目标：我想低成本地游荡英国，我想在全英文环境里锻炼英语，我想免费学习做咖啡，我想体验下人生副业的可能，尝试找到自己喜欢且擅长的事情。\r\n既然有了目标，我就在官网 [ https://substack.com/redirect/6638b711-7a85-4351-a8c8-e18d93f8cf2e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]（https://meditateinleicester.org/working-holiday/）填写了申请表，匹配对方的需求填写了信息。唯一有点难搞的是对方还需要雇主或是老师信息方便获得推荐信。这里我想坦白一下，我并没有找自己的老师或者雇主，而是为了方便找了朋友，虽然我不觉得这做得对，但我觉得在不损害原则的情况下也可以灵活一些（给自己找了些借口）。\r\n（莱斯特World peace cafe介绍）\r\n官网写完申请，对方联络了推荐人之后，我就收到了提醒邮件，邮件特别强调了寺庙打工换宿的重要原则，以及由于咖啡馆就在莱斯特市中心，繁忙的工作对体力要求比较高，需要慎重考虑是否能够接受。在我肯定的回复之后，对方就联系我约个WhatsApp视频通话。我很紧张地准备迎接人生第一次英文面试。\r\n为了通过这个英文面试，我想了几个方法，第一先把自己申请内容，基本信息用英文整理出来，方便记忆和练习，第二就是找ChatGPT进行模拟练习，ChatGPT扮演面试官对我进行提问，帮我熟悉英文交流这个场景，纠正发音和问题，第三就是上网搜索更多信息，有不少网友给了我很多建议，比如咖啡馆干活并不需要很多英文交流，再比如咖啡馆经理人很友好，志愿者之间也会互相帮助，这些都给了我不少信心。\r\n结果真的与咖啡馆视频通话后才发现，这完全不是面试，对方只是为了和我介绍工作内容，工作流程，报到和结束的时间，以及只提供素食食物，没有任何鱼和肉，问我是否能接受？我当然没问题，一个月而已，体验下素食生活又有何难。在视频通话没多久后，我就顺利收到了offer，虽然我的那些模拟练习并没有用上，但学习的英语并不会白费。\r\n后来也了解到，另一个成功的原因是这里还是很缺人的，所以条件合适申请成功的几率也会很高，这是我来了以后才了解到的。\r\n四、真正的挑战还在实战，我是怎么解决语言沟通和经验不足的？\r\n英国寺庙咖啡馆打工换宿实际是我在出发荷兰之前申请的，但没想到我在荷兰也顺利体验了打工换宿，而这八九天的换宿经验对我非常有帮助，不仅强化了英文的日常沟通交流，而且第一次体验了与外国人相处的生活，给了我很多信心。\r\n8月中旬，我结束了荷兰的游荡之旅，回到了西班牙，此时距离出发英国还有两周的时间，我可以做很多准备工作，特别是自己担心的语言沟通和缺乏咖啡馆经验的问题。\r\n如果用一句话总结解决的方法，那就是主动学习能解决绝大部分的问题，剩下的去实践就好。\r\n关于语言沟通，我用了这几种看起来笨拙但有效的方法\r\n第一，我把咖啡馆英文菜单背了下来，我让ChatGPT帮我翻译整理菜单的意思和发音，在notion专门搞了个文档记录，每天都复习一遍，做到能够把菜单熟记背诵的程度。好在这个素食咖啡馆菜单并不多，学习量不是很大。但我还特别找了食物过敏，素食相关的高频重要词汇记忆。\r\n第二，我把咖啡馆工作常用英语表达背了下来。网上搜索发现有非常多的资源，都是关于如何在咖啡馆用英文点单，以及如何用英文咖啡店打工，特别是很多在澳洲新西兰通过whv签证去咖啡馆工作的人，甚至会录制自己上班英文沟通的视频，帮助自己复盘check。我想了下自己如果是负责点单、服务最常用的表达是哪些，梳理了出来，也和菜单一样每天复习。常用表达其实很基础也简单，经常复习练习最大的效果就是能迅速说出来，说出来不结巴。\r\n第三，我找了8分钟简单英文视频跟读练习。这个视频名字就叫“English learning methods How to speak english fluently”，特别简单，不仅适合跟读练习，还能如标题学到英语学习的方法，最后还能在每天跟读的时候获得很多信心。这篇文章里分享了7个简单有效的英文学习方法（这里安利下莫不谷在游荡者 [

https://substack.com/redirect/26ea1775-7c87-4be0-b9c0-e7cf61a8ba6e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]后后台就可以查看的内容）：\r\nlisten to english everyday每天听英语；\r\nspeak everyday even alone即使独自一人也每天说英语；\r\ndont be afraid of mistakes不要害怕说错；\r\nlearn and use small sentences学习使用小短句；\r\ncopy and repeat after native speakers和母语者跟读重复；\r\nthink in english用英语思考；\r\ntalk with others and record yourself和别人用英语聊天然后记录下来。\r\n俗话说，学习方法和道理都懂，但就是做不到。一提学习就累就厌学的我是咋做到的呢？因为马上就去英国游荡，马上就去咖啡馆打工，基于短期实用目标的学习，就很容易启动，不需要学得多难多复杂，学习压力也不大，还不用怀疑学习的意义，因为学了就能用，所以厌学者学习的一个方法就是，找个感兴趣的目标。\r\n第四，我找ChatGPT每天陪练，我就让ChatGPT模拟各种需求的顾客点单，我来招待顾客，再让ChatGPT帮我纠正发音和表达，不花钱的专业教练，用起来方便有效！\r\n除此以外，我还找了各种英国、伦敦相关的电影电视剧，按照原速播放，尝试跟读练习，一边看电影一边磨耳朵一边磨嘴皮，还能对马上要去的英国有更深入的了解，比如《fleabag伦敦生活》《帕丁顿熊》《哈利波特》《唐顿庄园》《诺丁山》《莫里斯的情人》。\r\n也许大家看到这就累了，觉得太费劲。我觉得有一点很关键，你不需要英文很好才能出发和开始，你出发和开始之后，英文会变好，实在听不懂，跟着学，跟着看，就会做了。\r\n另外关于缺乏咖啡馆工作经验的部分：\r\n虽然我经常喝咖啡，但我并不知道如何制作咖啡，也不会使用咖啡机，想象了一下咖啡馆给我用英文讲解咖啡机如何操作我就担心自己头大，所以我又想了几个方法：\r\n第一，我把咖啡馆咖啡机型号找了出来，让ChatGPT直接识别图片，然后再找到对应的YouTube视频，看看咖啡机都是怎么使用的，咱们做些预习工作。\r\n第二，我把基础咖啡的区别和制作方法找了出来，了解了拿铁、卡布奇诺各种咖啡到底差别在哪，用英文如何表达，先有个基础印象，学起来也就容易一些。\r\n第三，我把咖啡馆所有关于志愿者工作的内容全部仔细研读了一遍，可以说事无巨细地了解了工作要求和注意事项。\r\n第四，我把咖啡馆的谷歌评价全部看了一遍，了解顾客好评，差评，觉得哪里有问题，比如志愿者搞不清食物成分和过敏的问题，制作速度太慢的问题，基本上就能了解咖啡馆运营情况。\r\n第五，我把咖啡馆海内外社交媒体都找了出来，方便了解工作环境，甚至还在YouTube找到了一个志愿者拍摄的vlog，我这个调研的程度可以去做狗仔了（不是）。\r\n所以通过学习视频还有充分调研，我基本上对工作有了了解，减少了很多想象的恐惧和担心。\r\n除了语言沟通和工作内容，我还对咖啡馆的背景做了调研了解，本身我对宗教和冥想没有兴趣，但咖啡馆是宗教背景下的，所以我就又去网上学习和了解，然后发现，这个宗教Nagarjuna Kadampa是有点问题，最大的问题是教义理念的封闭，教派管理的不透明，这就会限制人们有独立自主的思考和公平正当的权利。\r\n所以从宗教层面来说，我个人对此不赞同。从冥想方法来说，我认为这和深呼吸，做瑜伽一样是一种放松的方法。从咖啡馆志愿工作来说，我只需要把我感兴趣，想学的体验到就好。\r\n五、当我报到之后，英国寺庙咖啡馆实际体验如何，有哪些惊喜、意外和挑战？\r\n带着前面做的准备工作，我有些激动，兴奋，略微紧张的出发英国，先在伦敦玩了两天，然后坐大巴来到了莱斯特的world peace cafe，昨天是我第一天报到，今天是我第一天上岗，所以正好可以分享下寺庙咖啡馆打工换宿实际体验如何。\r\n首先说下报到情况\r\n第一天到莱斯特的初印象是小巧、干净、安静、舒适的城市，第一印象很宜居，又因为这里有莱斯特大学和印巴移民，相对多元化，饮食也丰富，非常期待即将在这里为期一个月的旅居生活。\r\n到达咖啡馆后，工作人员John让带我把房间里里外外以及日常工作生活注意事项事无巨细地讲解了一遍，非常耐心。我工作的咖啡馆就在莱斯特市中心大教堂正对面的一栋楼，一楼是咖啡馆和冥想厅，二楼是志愿者住宿，负一楼是中央厨房、志愿者专用厨房、储藏室等等。\r\n我和另外两个女生志愿者一起同住，一位是18岁高中毕业后选择gap的新西兰女生（她用自己在subway兼职两年攒的钱和认识8年的朋友背包从新西兰飞到欧洲环游，从5月到现在，已经4个月），另一位是完成英国本硕申请毕业生两年签证，留在英国寻找工作同时体验打工换宿的中国女生。\r\n（来自世界各地的志愿者，令人惊讶的是来自中国的也好多）\r\n顺利报到完毕，早已饥肠辘辘的我立刻去吃桂林米粉，据说非常正宗，我点了一份招牌卤味粉，吃到三分之一再加汤加醋，一粉两吃，嗦上这口粉，我感觉一秒穿越回到了广西，虽然我从没去过。\r\n（好吃的桂林米粉，我打算每周末改善我的伙食！）\r\n接着就迎来了第二天正式上岗\r\n说实话，早上在中央厨房集合，Manager布置任务的时候我有不少单词都没听懂，加上说的快，我又不熟悉情况，有很多一头雾水。好在我是新手，先跟着18岁的新西兰女生学习在厨房烧烤备菜，再上楼去吧台跟着中国女生学习制作三明治、卷饼、沙拉，接着学习如何刷碗整理、送单打扫，再到下午结束前的全部物品清洗，打扫卫生，准备次日食材。\r\n一整天下来，要学习的细节操作很多，但熟悉了上手也快，客人少的时候略感无聊，客人多的时候忙的头疼，但直到下班做清洁的时候，我有些惊讶一个简单的素食咖啡厅，没有任何油污，清洁的工作量都这么多，店里5个人都忙的头晕，到最后我已经进入神游状态，无比期待赶紧结束休息。\r\n不知道是因为第一天新手，所以觉得劳累，还是因为真的累，但我想到国内营业很长时间的咖啡馆、奶茶店可怕的工作量，我都不知道别人怎么做下来的，反正英国这个志愿者工作都给我累的不轻。\r\n（午餐Vegan delight，我做的时候都觉得素食主义者肯定开心，因为健康又好吃）\r\n第一天上岗有意思的部分是制作食物，给顾客送餐，思考中午要点菜单哪道食物，以及每天两杯免费饮料喝什么，还有就是和同事们的英文交流和文化交流。\r\n第一天上岗最有挑战让我灵魂出窍怀疑人生的部分是清洁洗手间，女士和客人专用洗手间都还好说，清理男性洗手间的时候我真的想逃。虽然客人都很有素质，卫生间已经干净的像是被打扫过的一样，但在这个基础上做清洁我还是心理障碍很大，18岁的新西兰女生一脸平静带着我打扫的时候，我当时脑海里冒出来的是：“我是谁，我在哪里，我在干吗？”\r\n如今也终于理解了康熙来了Melody的那句经典发言：“可是康永哥，他叫我洗马桶哎！”\r\n六、我的伦敦游荡之旅和有待开始的英国游荡计划！\r\n来到莱斯特之前，我提前两天到了伦敦，想着趁机会游荡下伦敦。第一天到达伦敦已经是凌晨三点，由于飞机延误，又被英国海关严格盘问，坐上机场大巴到市区的时候，看到了伦敦的夜晚。\r\n我很讶异凌晨的伦敦交通还这么繁忙，一路的汽车红灯，街上的行人和尚在营业的店铺都让人觉得它仿佛是24小时无需休息的不夜城。有趣的是看到了瘦瘦但四角圆润的红色双层巴士，非常像哈利波特电影里，小天狼星帮助哈利主动叫的巫师紧急巴士，可以快速穿梭在街道，还能够变得非常狭窄从两辆巴士中间穿过。宛宛类卿，这种熟悉的亲切感让人不自觉便为伦敦添上一份喜爱的滤镜。同时也能理解为什么伦敦能是第一个建设地铁的都市，既然地面已经不够，那就挖掘地下的可能。\r\n早上醒来迎来了伦敦的白天，入乡随俗，我去莱斯特广场体验了一份经典的英国早餐，煎蛋、培根、薯饼、烤番茄和鹰嘴豆酱，不仅意外的味道不错，而且相对健康低脂。接着我便开启了暴走模式，去唐人街买上唐人饼家现烤的迷你鲷鱼烧，再打包一份香葱肉松面包，好去大英博物馆游览。\r\n大英博物馆最美的是有着蓝色穹顶和窗户的阅览室，与暗红或棕色的的书籍搭配起来，像是一幅沉静的静物油画像。大英博物馆最震惊我的是有着数量众多，种类丰富的埃及木乃伊和展品，多到让我觉得比埃及本土还多。这个有着800多万件展品，实际展出8万多件像是收藏了世界文明史的博物馆，从成立之出就明确为了公众知识传播，永久免费进入，伦敦寸土寸金，消费并不便宜，但像大都市纽约一样，它有太多免费的精神养料。\r\n大英图书馆距离博物馆不远，在结束博物馆游览后，我便来到了图书馆，比起平平无奇的图书馆，更令我惊讶的是旁边夺人眼球的圣潘克拉斯文艺复兴酒店，这栋1868年建成的红砖哥特式的建筑，有着气派的尖顶、拱门、精美的雕刻，矗立在现代化的街道之上，让人无法忽视。\r\n恰巧，这旁边就是国王十字街站，《哈利波特》9¾站台（Platform 9¾）的拍摄地。出发前已经重温三集哈利波特的我又怎能错过呢，到了站台才发现，想要合影留念的人已经排了大长队伍，我便没有加入这个热闹，从边边拍一张已经心满意足。打卡点旁边便是哈利波特周边商店，虽然我没有任何想买的，但走进这个店里，就好像穿越进了哈利波特的电影里，看送信的海德薇，自由的多比，会蹦出青蛙的零食，杰克罗琳创造了魔法世界，也用创造给人们带来了对欢愉、勇气和自由的向往。\r\n走出魔法商店，已经是下午四点钟，疲乏的我便决定坐车去伦敦桥，吃碗担担面休息补充下，再继续游荡一下。而我最推荐的citywalk路线是从伦敦桥一路沿着泰晤士河边，走到泰特现代艺术馆，吹风，看河，看落日余晖，也看散步休闲的人，沿着这条路走，还能路过莎士比亚环球剧场，只要5英镑就可以买到站票看一场精彩的莎士比亚戏剧演出，演员还会和场下观众互动，据说是感受英国文化非常值得的体验，暴走已经疲惫无力再站着看剧，以及英文水平还不足以理解剧情的我选择继续沿着泰晤士河散步回家，等不到日落便倒头就睡，在睡眠里消解日行三万步的疲惫。\r\n离开伦敦的早上，我五点多便醒了，趁着10点退房前，我走去海德公园散步，看看伦敦的清晨。海德公园并没有想象的丰富美丽，但你走进去也不会感到后悔，看着海鸥、乌鸦、天鹅沐浴清晨，灰松鼠在阳光的缝隙里跳来跳去，湖边还有指示牌画出这个公园生态小自然里各种各样的动物，甚至还有猫头鹰、老鹰和狐狸，心里便不自觉柔软许多，对海德公园也生出更亲近的感情。\r\n从海德公园散步回来，卡文迪许公园终于在8点开了门，不用走得很近，远远看到鲜花堆放的椅子，就知道那是大S的纪念长椅。就像莫不谷在《这个世界可爱的人不多，你是其中重要的一个》写到那样：\r\n“请你们不要被噪音遮蔽，这个世界有真心的人，很多都在爱你们，或明或暗，常常地想念你们。”\r\n我把大S照片上的灰尘拂去，把莫不谷写的文字转述，把关心和想念表达出来。To remember her is to love her.\r\n从卡文迪许公园出来，走着走着，我的内心突然涌起一股情感，突然感到了自由的价值。现在我没有上班，也没有拥有很多金钱，未来的方向也还没有明确，但我有了宝贵的自由的时间，可以通过打工换宿探索低成本游荡世界的方式，即便是寸土寸金的伦敦和纽约，我也可以像来看望大S一样，去到我想去的地方。想到我此刻拥有的自由，和还可以探索的未来，我有些兴奋和激动。\r\n9月是伦敦的初秋，我感觉自己在英国最好的季节来到了这里，天气温和凉爽，梧桐叶落满地，有时候一起风我也想被吹到云朵里跳跃飞舞一下。\r\n我把这一刻出奇的激动和兴奋记录在Notion人生乐事lists，当虚无和沮丧敲门之时，我想把它拿出来作为呼神护卫，对未来生活美好的想象就是我的魔法咒语，用以对抗摄魂怪的来袭。\r\n结束了短暂的伦敦游荡，接下来我将探索莱斯特这个小城，然后在周日和周一休息的时候坐flixbus去英国其它的城市，诺丁汉、林肯等等游荡，和我一起工作的中国女生邀请我一起去谢菲尔德，她要带我游览这座城市。\r\n最后的最后，是伦敦游荡一系列图片分享！\r\n为全球华人游荡者提供解决方案的平台：游荡者（www.youdangzhe.com）\r\n这世界的辽阔和美好，游荡者知道。使用过程中遇到问题，欢迎联系客服邮箱wanderservice2024@outlook.com.\r\n\r\n【放学以后文章&书籍&其它】\r\n\r\n解锁放学以后《创作者手册：从播客开始说起》：https://afdian.com/item/ffcd59481b9411ee882652540025c377\r\n\r\n解锁莫不谷《做一个“蓄意”的游荡者》口袋书：\r\n爱发电：https://afdian.com/item/62244492ae8611ee91185254001e7c00微信公众号：《放学以后After

It also operates the world’s most-visited website, and the second most-visited one, too: YouTube. Founded in 1998, Google generated the single largest profit ($115B after all costs and taxes) of all companies globally, last year.\r\nAside from its size, Google is known for its engineering-first culture, and for having a high recruitment bar for software engineers who, in return, get a lot of autonomy and enjoy good terms and conditions. Employees are known as “Googlers,” and new joiners – “Nooglers” – get fun swag when they start. An atmosphere of playful intellectual curiosity is encouraged in the workplace, referred to internally as “Googleyness” – more on which, later. This culture is a major differentiator from other Big Tech workplaces.\r\nBut what is it really like to work at Google? What’s the culture like, how are things organized, how do teams get things done – and how different is Google from any other massive tech business, truly?\r\nThis article is a “things I wish I’d known about Google before joining as an SWE / engineering manager”. It’s for anyone who wants to work at Google, and is also a way to learn, understand, and perhaps get inspired by approaches that work for one of the world’s leading companies.\r\nThis mini-series of articles focusing on Google contains more information about more aspects of its engineering culture than has been published in one place before, I believe. We’ve spent close to 12 months researching it, including having conversations with 25 current and former engineering leaders and software engineers at Google; the majority of whom are at Staff (L6) level or above.\r\nOf course, it’s impossible to capture every detail of a place with more than 60,000 software engineers, and whose product areas (Google’s version of orgs) and teams work in different ways. Google gives a lot of freedom to engineers and teams to decide how they operate, and while we cannot cover all that variety, we aim to provide a practical, helpful overview.\r\nIn part 1 of this mini-series, we cover:\r\nOverview. Google generates more revenue than Microsoft and Meta, and is the Big Tech giant that likely employs the most software engineers across 25+ engineering offices. The mission statement is to “organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.”\r\nWhat makes Google special? Behind the variety of approaches to work is a universal engineering culture for tools and practices. Google has a unique, custom engineering stack, and has built systems differently from competitors since day one, making it a “tech island”. Google has historically been more open than other Big Tech companies about its inner workings. With 120+ active products, it is most similar to Microsoft in the breadth of work it does, and in the opportunities there are for software engineers to work on different things.\r\nLevels and roles. There’s a dual-track career ladder between levels L2 and L11, and a Tech Lead Manager (TLM) role as a “third career path”. Google’s leveling process during interviews is the strictest in the industry, and “tech lead” is a role, not a level. Other engineering roles include SRE, EngProd, Research Scientist, DevRel, and UXE. Other roles that interact with engineering include Product Managers, Program Managers, TPMs [ https://substack.com/redirect/0be67403-b918-458f-bd08-f7016d5a489b?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], designers, and tech writers.\r\nCompensation. Google pays at the top of regional markets, and is known for its standout compensation which includes base pay, equity, cash bonus, and sometimes a signing-on bonus. Examples of this top-of-market pay:\r\nMid-level engineer (L4) usually pays in the range of:\r\n$250-350K in total compensation in the US\r\nOther regions: £125-185K in the UK, €140-180K in Germany, CHF 210-260K in Switzerland, CA$210-280K in Canada, A$200-280K in Australia, zł380-450K in Poland, and ₹65-88 lakh in India\r\nStaff software engineer (L6) usually pays in the range of:\r\n$550-700K in total compensation in the US\r\nOther regions: £270-380K in the UK, €250-330K in Germany, CHF 370-500K in Switzerland, CA$420-650K in Canada, A$350-550K in Australia, zł750-850K in Poland, and ₹1.5-2.2 crore in India\r\nWe cover entry-level (L3), senior (L5), senior staff (L7) packages, and also Google-specific bonuses like peer bonuses, spot bonuses, and award programmes.\r\nGoogle is one of few companies to offer a financially rewarding career path for engineers which doesn’t push them into management\r\nHiring. Google has a notoriously difficult interview process which is copied by many other tech companies. Data structures and algorithms interviews, system design, “Googleyness”, and leadership interviews are also features of recruitment, and some teams use domain deepdives and takehomes. Final recruitment decisions are made by a Hiring Committee, but that’s still not the end of the process – successful candidates then go through “team matching”.\r\nThis article is around twice as long as most deepdives; there are just so many details worth sharing about Google!\r\nFor similar deepdives, see Inside Meta’s engineering culture [ https://substack.com/redirect/e0fe9280-9474-4a1d-84db-4468018d793d?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], Inside Amazon’s engineering culture [ https://substack.com/redirect/50881997-3e14-4b2c-8413-8c497ac2f877?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], and other engineering culture deepdives [ https://substack.com/redirect/08d04e67-5e40-4449-a628-9564501bfa9f?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] — including that of OpenAI, Stripe and Figma.\r\nProgramming note: this week, an episode of The Pragmatic Engineer Podcast will be released tomorrow (Wednesday), and there will be no edition of The Pulse.\r\nThe bottom of this article could be cut off in some email clients.

Overview\r\nLet’s begin with a quick rundown of the numbers that give Google the most users and customers of any business, globally:\r\n#1 and #2 most-visited websites: Google.com is the most popular website [ https://substack.com/redirect/1550fc11-4361-4195-942b-812ed386479b?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] in the world, and YouTube is #2. Google.com gets 85 billion monthly visits [ https://substack.com/redirect/ab311a89-9b54-456d-8110-b7321138030a?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] – more than the next 9 most-visited websites, combined\r\nAndroid: around 4.2 billion [ https://substack.com/redirect/000b9c4c-1346-4dc5-b32d-b73e8611992e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] users (circa 75% of global smartphone market share)\r\nChrome: circa 3.45 billion [ https://substack.com/redirect/16237af6-3c4c-4004-91de-46fd3757710d?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] users (around 65% of global browser market share)\r\nGmail: approximately 1.8 billion [ https://substack.com/redirect/acb1ce2d-c9ec-46b0-acc9-f8021999fdb9?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] active users\r\nIn 2015 when Google renamed itself “Alphabet”, the motivation was to separate the core web search business that earned the lion’s share of revenue from loss-making, “moonshot” ventures like Waymo, Google DeepMind, Google Fiber, etc. In practice, almost all revenue generated by Alphabet comes from the Google organizational unit, and not much has changed since. This article uses the name “Google” when referencing Alphabet.\r\nIncredibly profitable & ads-heavy\r\nIn absolute terms, Google is currently the most profitable company in the world; it generated $115 billion in profit (net income) over the past 12 months on $371 billion in revenue. For comparison, here are other Big Tech companies’ net incomes during the period:\r\nMicrosoft: $101 billion (from $281 billion in revenue)\r\nApple: $99 billion ($408 billion revenue)\r\nMeta: $71 billion ($178 billion revenue)\r\nAmazon: $70 billion ( $670 billion revenue)\r\nAt its core, Google is still an advertising company; around 75% of revenue comes from selling ads on Google Search, YouTube, and the Google Ads network. However, the business has several services that don’t rely on ads for revenue:\r\nGoogle Cloud: the #3 cloud provider behind AWS and Azure generates more than $50 billion in annual revenue (around 13% of total revenue). Google Workspace income is included in this number.\r\nHardware plus subscriptions: Pixel smartphones, Nest smart home gadgets, Fitbit wearables, YouTube Premium, and Google One subscriptions. Google makes more than $40 billion per year from these (circa 10% of revenue)\r\nGoogle has several loss-making businesses that might one day turn a profit, such as:\r\nGemini and AI: Google is a leader in AI with its Gemini models that are integrated in several products like web search. It is both a free and paid product, and is likely loss-making at present.\r\nWaymo: the leader in self-driving vehicles, now serving more than 1 million rides per month in San Francisco and Phoenix, in the US.\r\nGoogle Fiber: ultra-fast fiber-optic provider with data speeds from 1 Gbps to 8 Gbps. It operates in 25 cities across 19 US states, including Austin (Texas), Atlanta (Georgia), Chicago (Illinois), Miami (Florida), Denver (Colorado), and San Diego (California).\r\nGlobal offices\r\nGoogle employs 183,000 people worldwide and hit peak headcount in 2022, with 190,000 workers. In 2023, there were mass layoffs and headcount has since stopped rising:\r\nAs mentioned above, Google employs around 60,000 software engineers, which we can deduce because in 2020 this number was 50,000, as shared [ https://substack.com/redirect/c1b9498e-6853-4d7d-b9b6-ad7adf310f08?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] in the book “Software Engineering at Google,” – around 35% of all staff. Headcount growth since that time suggests that 60K engineers work there today. This makes Google one of the largest employers of software engineers; Amazon employs nearly 35,000 [ https://substack.com/redirect/50881997-3e14-4b2c-8413-8c497ac2f877?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] developers, and Meta around 32,000 [ https://substack.com/redirect/e0fe9280-9474-4a1d-84db-4468018d793d?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] software engineers. We’re confident Google has the highest “software engineering ratio” among the Big Tech giants.\r\nGoogle runs more than 25 engineering offices. The biggest:\r\nUS: Mountain View (corporate headquarters) and the surrounding Bay Area, San Francisco, New York, and Seattle (Kirkland), plus several smaller ones in places like Cambridge (MA), Los Angeles (CA), San Diego (CA), Pittsburgh (PA), Raleigh and Durham (NC).\r\nCanada: Toronto, Montreal, Waterloo, and Kitchener\r\nEurope: Zurich (Switzerland), London (UK), Dublin (Ireland), Munich (Germany), and Paris (France) are the largest. Smaller offices include Hamburg (Germany), Milan (Italy), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Madrid (Spain), Stockholm (Sweden), Copenhagen and Aarhus (Denmark), Helsinki (Finland), Warsaw and Krakow (Poland), Prague (Czechia), Vilnius (Lithuania), Bucharest (Romania), and Budapest (Hungary).\r\nIndia: Bangalore and Hyderabad are the largest offices.\r\nSouth America: Mexico City (Mexico), Sāo Paulo and Belo Horizonte (Brazil)\r\nAsia and Australia: Tokyo (Japan), Sydney (Australia), New Taipei City (Taiwan)\r\nGoogle has more than 70 offices [ https://substack.com/redirect/8dbc49cd-615a-4dcc-a6fe-3935069fc5bf?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] across 50+ countries. The total number of offices is higher than engineering offices, because many of Google’s offices have no software engineering teams in those locations, but are for non-technical teams like Sales, Marketing, Consulting (e.g. for Google Cloud), and other functions.\r\nAlthough not typical, Google can hire engineers to work from mainly non-engineering offices as “singletons”. A current Google engineer told us:\r\n“Singletons are not particularly common, but rather exceptions on an individual basis. Some are left-overs from a brief period of remote hiring during the pandemic, some are specialists or very senior ICs who have a bit more leverage in negotiations and choice of where they work.”\r\n“Singletons” can also work in engineering offices: in that case, they would be the lone engineer working for their team in that location, everyone else on their team being in other locations. Singletons are not common at Google, but our research suggests there are many more of them than at other Big Tech companies and larger scaleups.\r\nHistory, mission, values\r\nAs is well known by now, Google was founded by PhD students Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who devised a more efficient search engine algorithm called PageRank [ https://substack.com/redirect/54b6bed9-3104-4aea-be1d-66eadd42c6d7?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]. Using PageRank for searching the web resulted in much-improved results than the most popular rival search engines of the time, such as Yahoo!, AltaVista, Lycos, and Ask Jeeves. Some of these were portals which “featured” sites to visit (like AltaVista), and others were rudimentary search engines that gave up to 15 not-particularly-accurate results.\r\nThe rest, as they say, is history: two years after launching, Google became the dominant search engine and also a verb (“let me Google this.”) It gave more and better search results, and had a much cleaner interface than its rivals.\r\nThe company’s mission has changed over time:\r\n“Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful”. This was the founding mission in 1998 and hasn’t changed.\r\n“Don’t be evil”. An unofficial motto which was part of Google’s code of conduct from around [ https://substack.com/redirect/cc217015-c310-4eff-baa0-09f077b9adf2?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] 2000, to remind staff to act ethically. It remained until 2015, when Google became Alphabet.\r\n“Do the right thing”. The motto for the company since 2015 [ https://substack.com/redirect/d681fcf0-19f7-40eb-ac20-8b974cae4a8c?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], which replaced “don’t be evil”.\r\nGoogle also has five core values [ https://substack.com/redirect/9dc93301-86d5-431a-be50-6b6038fdc2c1?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]:\r\nProtecting users\r\nBuilding and deploying AI responsibly\r\nExpanding opportunity\r\nHelping solve society’s challenges\r\nBuilding for everyone\r\nCurrent Googlers report that these values are not particularly emphasized during day-to-day work, and that they feel pretty abstract and “corporate”. This light-touch approach is different from competitors like online retailer Amazon, whose 16 leadership principles [ https://substack.com/redirect/c0d50886-703d-445c-b944-fcad45ea595a?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] might as well be chiselled in stone on the walls.\r\n“Googleyness” is something most workers at the company share. It’s a trait Google focuses on during its hiring process as something all employees should possess. The term is vague, but adds up to being smart, adaptable, and a team player who’s nice to be around. We cover Googleyness more in the “Hiring” section.\r\nThere are plenty of publicly observable instances of “Googleyness” in Google’s own products, which show just how engineering-driven its culture is. For example, try searching “recursion” on Google:\r\n2. What makes Google special?\r\nFrom talking with 25 current and former Googlers, here’s what makes it distinct from other Big Tech companies.\r\nNo “single” Google\r\nGoogle is divided into Product Areas which operate like standalone companies. These are often called “PAs” or “orgs” internally. The main PAs:\r\nKnowledge and Information: includes Google Search, internal platforms, and core services\r\nYouTube: everything related to the video-sharing arm\r\nCloud: Google Cloud Platform and Workspace\r\nAds and Monetization: products like Google Ads, AdSense, and AdMob\r\nPlatforms and Devices: software platforms like Android, Chrome, Chrome OS, and hardware like Pixel, Nest, Fitbit, Chromecast, Google TV, and Google Home devices\r\nOrgs have their own goals, priorities, metrics, and planning cadences. And within each org, teams have a lot of independence to decide their way of working. An engineer’s experience in one team in an org can be very different from another engineer’s in a different team in another org! Here’s how one current Google engineer explained it to us:\r\n“Your experience is heavily dependent on your team. If you work on a mature product, you will be met with a lot of process. If you work in a more zero-to-one project, there is more code to be written.”\r\nA tech lead confirmed that priorities differ by PA:\r\n“Priorities between PAs differ drastically. In all fairness, they are also different between subteams in the same PA. Google is very into peer-to-peer negotiation to get things done, as opposed to top-down priorities. Personally, I find the amount of negotiation to be a little inefficient and exhausting, and would not say no to more top-down direction!”\r\nOne engineering culture\r\nEven though product areas and teams work independently, the engineering culture seems pretty universal, judging by the engineers we’ve talked to.\r\nPractices, tooling, and tech stacks are very similar. Whether someone works in YouTube, Ads and Commerce, or another product area, they use the same internal tools, the same processes for things like code review, testing, and documentation, and also the same monorepo and continuous integration processes – except for a few open source projects like Android and Chromium.\r\nThat most of Google’s 60,000 engineers use almost identical tooling means it is little effort to move teams, which helps make internal moves easy, as it involves a lot less change to processes and tooling, meaning a lower cognitive load that makes onboarding faster, overall.\r\nPolitics and culture vary between PAs and teams. It would be impossible for the culture to be identical in thousands of engineering teams, split across dozens of locations. Here are the big differences, according to engineers:\r\nPolitics. How do you influence decision makers in your org to prioritize things that matter to your team? Doing so requires being good at the subtle art of influencing, knowing the most influential people, and making them your allies. This is a tricky business at any mid-sized or larger company. We previously covered internal politics for software engineers and managers [ https://substack.com/redirect/f277c2cc-5402-4ed7-b6e1-2a3ccf92ccb6?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ].\r\nCulture and perf. Google says there’s “one engineering culture,” but engineers told us that different orgs prioritize different things; some value quality more, others focus on innovation, and others prioritize shipping fast. Performance evaluation is known as GRAD (Google Reviews and Development) and is org-specific, meaning expectations for each level differ slightly across orgs. We will cover this topic in part two of this mini-series.\r\nUnique engineering stack\r\nGoogle’s engineering org exists in a different world from that which other tech companies operate in. This comes down to one thing: scale.\r\nGoogle had to build systems at the scale of serving hundreds of millions of users a decade before any other company in the world reached a similar scale. This meant it innovated unique systems and solutions to massive scaling challenges, and that publicly-available tools were shipped outside Google only a decade or so later.\r\nWhatever tools or vendors your current company uses to deal with scale, it’s likely that Google built its own versions 10 or more years earlier:\r\nBorg (manage containers at scale): predates container orchestration platform, Kubernetes\r\nBorgmon/Monarch (observability at scale): predates observability solution, Datadog\r\nCodesearch (code searching in massive codebases): predates code search vendor, Sourcegraph\r\nPiper (source control at Google scale): predates source control leader, GitHub\r\nGoogle occupies an unusual position where it makes no sense to adopt industry-standard tools like GitHub and Kubernetes because its existing stack is so well integrated. A current Google engineer explained why it rarely uses external services or tools, even if they can handle Google’s scale:\r\n“Google makes everything work so well. Since the entire tech stack is in-house, every system has built-in transparent integration with the in-house corporate authn/z system, and also with the ‘magical billing’ system.\r\nExternal products always have to:\r\nProvide auth abstractions\r\nProvide billing abstractions\r\nThese two constraints make adopting new tools really friggin' hard!”\r\nBuilding systems differently since day one\r\nEngineering at Google has been different from the rest of the world since it was founded. From its beginnings in 1998, the company bet big on speed and reliability being differentiators for all its products. They expected the web search tool to deal with planet-scale load, and the same for subsequent products like Gmail that launched with 1GB of free storage in 2004. This was unheard of at a time when storage was much more expensive. The assumption was that these products needed to be able to handle billions of users.\r\nTo achieve this scale, Google simply had to build a custom tech stack from the start, as there were no commercially-available tech stacks around to handle planet-scale load. Back in the late ‘90s, the conventional wisdom was to vertically scale machines; that is, buy the biggest possible server (called a mainframe), and try to make an application run on a single server. Sun was one of the biggest mainframe vendors of the time, and most companies invested heavily in expensive, high-performance hardware.\r\nGoogle took a different route by choosing to buy cheap, commodity hardware, and to build data center clusters that made use of tens of thousands of relatively cheap machines to handle loads that not even the largest mainframes in the world could soak up.\r\nHere’s how Google’s search cluster worked in 2003, from the Google whitepaper [ https://substack.com/redirect/84582098-8bfa-46cf-9d21-b5bba8b9cff5?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] describing the Google cluster architecture:\r\n“To provide sufficient capacity to handle query traffic, our service consists of multiple clusters distributed worldwide.\r\nEach cluster has around a few thousand machines, and the geographically distributed setup protects us against catastrophic data center failures (like those arising from earthquakes and large-scale power failures).\r\nA DNS-based load-balancing system selects a cluster by accounting for the user’s geographic proximity to each physical cluster. The load-balancing system minimizes round-trip time for the user’s request, while also considering the available capacity at the various clusters”.\r\nBack then, this kind of approach was revolutionary, and no other company published so much detail about its custom data center setup. Google kept publishing details on how it organized and operated clusters, such as this writeup in the “Site Reliability Engineering at Google [ https://substack.com/redirect/fd863ab7-ef61-4401-a19c-5ad852e838a2?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]” book:\r\n“The topology of a Google data center:\r\nTens of machines are placed in a rack.\r\nRacks stand in a row.\r\nOne or more rows form a cluster.\r\nUsually a datacenter building houses multiple clusters.\r\nMultiple datacenter buildings that are located close together form a campus”.\r\nUnusual openness\r\nCompared to every other Big Tech company, Google has been very open and transparent about how it works externally and internally. Note, this openness seems to have reduced since around 2020.\r\nInternally, basically everything used to be available to all workers: planning docs, strategies, code, documentation, et-al. This company-wide access changed to Product Area-wide access following leaks in 2020. A former Google Cloud engineer told us:\r\n“The ‘default open’ policy started to change around 2019-2020. This was when GCP got involved with more potentially controversial topics, and confidential documents were leaked to the press more often.\r\nThe default share setting for internal Google Docs used to be company-wide visibility. From around 2019-2020, the default visibility is PA-level visibility, meaning you can only search documents in your PA, not from across Google.”\r\nExternally, Google has published more than 10,000 papers [ https://substack.com/redirect/c83f0b03-50da-44d5-b909-3fd85f4cfd06?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ] with details about how the company works and how products are built. No other business has published more about its inner workings.\r\nFamously, in 2017 Google published a paper titled Attention is All You Need [ https://substack.com/redirect/70a1de11-5953-472f-8c29-99237147e3b8?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ], describing a novel network architecture called “transformers.” This paper was the foundation for Large Language Models (LLMs) and this idea is at the core of ChatGPT and other LLMs. By publishing this paper instead of holding on to its breakthrough, Google may have brought forward the AI boom by a few years!\r\nTech island\r\nEverything about software engineering is unique at Google. New joiners can throw out their knowledge of how to use source control, how to run CI/CD, and how to manage infrastructure. Google has different, unique systems for everything related to building, deploying, and maintaining software, and all of it has to be learnt.\r\nThe term “tech island” was coined by Urs Hölzle, Google employee #8, in an internal document nearly a decade ago. As a former Googler told us:...\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzbGV0dGVyLnByYWdtYXRpY2VuZ2luZWVyLmNvbS9hY3Rpb24vZGlzYWJsZV9lbWFpbD90b2tlbj1leUoxYzJWeVgybGtJam95TXpJMU16UXpOVElzSW5CdmMzUmZhV1FpT2pFM016RTRPRE13TlN3aWFXRjBJam94TnpVM05ETXhOemszTENKbGVIQWlPakUzT0RnNU5qYzNPVGNzSW1semN5STZJbkIxWWkwME5UZzNNRGtpTENKemRXSWlPaUprYVhOaFlteGxYMlZ0WVdsc0luMC5OUC1WTnJJRk01WDlGUUJZRXEzUVdIcURObWFiZy1jWUg4X2czSV85VU1VIiwicCI6MTczMTg4MzA1LCJzIjo0NTg3MDksImYiOnRydWUsInUiOjIzMjUzNDM1MiwiaWF0IjoxNzU3NDMxNzk3LCJleHAiOjIwNzMwMDc3OTcsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0wIiwic3ViIjoibGluay1yZWRpcmVjdCJ9.x5er8wgdcY490TvSxY8uv2AW101eRSUsgi2mLJQLs-w?",

This is a game changer for inference, and its significance is surpassed only by the March 2024 announcement of the GB200 NVL72 Oberon rack-scale form factor. Only with hardware specialized to the very different phases of inference, prefill and decode, can disaggregated serving achieve its full potential.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the rack system design gap between Nvidia and its competitors has become canyon-sized. AMD and custom silicon competitors may have made a small step forward in emulating Nvidia’s 72-GPU rack scale design, but Nvidia has just made another Giant Leap, again leaving competitors very distant objects in the rear-view mirror.\r\n\r\nAMD and ASICs has already been investing heavily to catch up in terms of its own rack-scale solutions and has been working tirelessly to improve their software stack to try to close the gap with Nvidia, but now it needs to redouble its investment yet again as it will have to develop its own prefill chip, delaying further the timeframe with which they can close the gap. With this announcement, all of Nvidia’s competitors will be sent back to the drawing board to reconfigure their entire roadmaps again in a repeat of how Oberon changed roadmaps across the industry.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nThe Rubin CPX\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nBecause the prefill stage during inference tends to heavily utilize compute (FLOPS) and only lightly use memory bandwidth, running prefill on a chip with lots of expensive HBM featuring very high memory bandwidth is a waste. The answer is a chip that is skinny on memory bandwidth and relatively fat on compute. Enter the Rubin CPX GPU.\r\n\r\nSource: Nvidia\r\n\r\nThe Rubin CPX features 20 PFLOPS of FP4 dense compute but only 2TB/s of memory bandwidth. It also features 128GB of GDDR7 memory, a lower quantity of less expensive memory when compared to the VR200. By comparison, the dual-die R200 chip offers 33.3 PFLOPS of FP4 dense and 288GB of HBM offering 20.5 TB/s of memory bandwidth.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Rubin CPX expands the VR200 family of rack scale servers into three flavors:\r\n\r\n* VR200 NVL144: 72 GPUs packages across 18 compute trays, with 4 R200 GPU packages in each compute tray.\r\n* VR200 NVL144 CPX: 72 Logical GPUs packages in addition to 144 Rubin CPX GPU packages across 18 compute trays, with 4 R200 GPU packages and 8 Rubin CPX GPU  packages in each compute tray.\r\n* Vera Rubin CPX Dual Rack: Two discrete racks – one VR200 NVL144 rack plus one VR CPX rack with 144 Rubin CPX GPUs across 18 compute trays, with 8 Rubin CPX GPUs in each compute tray.\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia\r\n\r\nIn this report, we will first explain the story so far and the impetus for the development of the Rubin CPX because of the different role memory plays during prefill and decode phases of inference. We will then dive deep into the architecture of the Rubin CPX chip and the rack-scale solutions where it is deployed. We will then shift focus from the past and present to what the future holds with respect to disaggregated inference serving and how today’s announcement impacts future roadmaps and competitiveness for other merchant accelerator providers and custom silicon projects. In the final part of this article, we will briefly present a comprehensive list of key bill of materials (BoM) items for both racks and a power budget analysis by major component groups.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nMemory: The Story So Far\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe memory wall has been the most important constraint for AI. Larger memory capacities have been necessary to load larger models into accelerators, while memory bandwidth has been the main gating factor for inference and training token throughput. This is why high bandwidth memory (HBM) capacity and bandwidth per GPU have increased rapidly – from 80GB and 3.4TB/s for the H100 to 288GB and 8.0TB/s for the GB300, more than tripling memory capacity and increasing bandwidth by ~2.5x in less than three years.\r\n\r\nConsequently, HBM has consistently increased as a % of accelerator BOM from Hopper to Blackwell, with HBM now being the largest single component of the package BOM for the GB300. HBM is extremely valuable for both training and inference, but when we break down inference to its constituent parts of prefill and decode steps, HBM only has high value for the decode step. During prefill, which is compute intensive, the generation of KVCache is much less bandwidth intensive due to the parallel nature of prefill, therefore the HBM is underutilized during this step.\r\n\r\nHBM carries such an expensive premium relative to other forms of DRAM because of its additional bandwidth, and when this B/W is underutilized, this HBM is “wasted”. The escalating proportion of BOM taken up by HBM presents yet another “wall” and is the impetus behind the development of the Rubin CPX GPU.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis\r\n\r\nNow that we have briefly explored the role memory has played thus far, let’s pivot to today’s announcement and explore in detail the architecture of the Rubin CPX and the rack scale servers where it is deployed.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\nBandwidth and Compute Difference\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nEach Rubin CPX chip will be a monolithic SoC on a conventional flip chip BGA package. Instead of HBM, Rubin CPX will have 128GB of GDDR7 DRAM. Switching from using HBM to cheaper GDDR7 memory reduces the cost per GB by more than 50%.\r\n\r\nMemory speeds will likely be at 32Gbps with a 512-bit bus. This results in 2TB/s of memory bandwidth per Rubin CPX compared to 20.5TB/s of memory bandwidth per R200. Notably, with this keynote, Nvidia also confirms a significant bandwidth upgrade for regular Rubin. R200’s HBM4 speeds have been significantly increased to 10Gbps to achieve 20.5TB/s of memory bandwidth per R200 as we discussed in the Accelerator and HBM model previously ( https://semianalysis.com/accelerator-hbm-model/ ). This compares to the R200 being first unveiled as “only” having 13TB/s of memory bandwidth specifications at a 6.4Gbps speed bin. We discussed and quantify the impacts to HBM suppliers in the model as well ( https://semianalysis.com/accelerator-hbm-model/ ). The 144 CPX chips that each deliver 2.0 TB/s of memory bandwidth and the 72 R200 chips that deliver 20.5TB/s will combine to deliver total system memory bandwidth of 1.7PB/s.\r\n\r\nFor compute, each CPX offers 30 PFLOPs of sparse FP4 computing throughput (20 PFLOP dense) compared to the R200 at 50 PFLOPs sparse FP4 (33.3 PFLOPs dense). Dense PFLOPs for the Rubin CPX follow the same 3:2 sparse to dense ratio as the R200 because it inherits a similar tensor core architecture as Rubin R200. The CPX offers very strong FP4 compute throughput for a single compute die relative to the two dies for R200. The gains are likely from reducing higher precision compute units to have more FP4 ALUs. This was what was implemented with the B300 to get higher FP4 throughput than the B200 while staying on the same 4NP node.\r\n\r\nHowever, as always, peak theoretical FLOPs are extremely hard to attain in practice. Like Nvidia’s other GPUs that are power-limited, it will be very difficult for Rubin CPX to sustain anywhere close to peak FLOPs given what we estimate to be rated power of only around 800W: we do not see it feasible to break past 1W/mm2 of power density, especially as the board comes is integrated in a sandwiched form factor (more on this below).\r\n\r\nWhat is also different is the network. There is no NVLink SerDes for scale-up, instead Rubin CPX relies on PCIe Gen 6 to talk to other GPUs through the CX-9 NICs on the scale-out network. This reduced network capability is more than feasible through implementing pipeline parallelism which we discuss below.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis Accelerator & HBM Model ( https://semianalysis.com/accelerator-hbm-model/ ) , AI TCO Model ( https://semianalysis.com/ai-cloud-tco-model/ ) , Above Figures are Demonstrative\r\n\r\nBecause of the lower total silicon content and less expensive memory, the production cost of Rubin CPX is drastically lower than that of the R200. Lowering total memory capacity and using lower cost GDDR7 means that memory cost is 5x lower. The chip architecture is also far simpler since avoiding HBM and only have a single reticle-sized die without any I/O chiplets means CoWoS packaging is not required. For perspective, the design of Rubin CPX is similar to a next-generation RTX 5090 or RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, as both use a large monolithic die with a 512-bit wide GDDR7 memory interface. As these chips are based on the consumer Blackwell GPU die, those chips only have 20% of the FLOPS as their HBM-enabled big brother, the B200. With Rubin CPX, this ratio jumps to 60% as it will be a separate tapeout that looks closer to the R200 compute die. As an exercise in achieving maximum FLOPS per unit cost – Rubin CPX is unmatched.\r\n\r\nLater in the article, we will break down the BOM advantage of Rubin CPX and estimate how much can be saved by moving prefill off R200 and onto Rubin CPX.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nNvidia Oberon Rack Architecture Upgrade: VR NVL144 CPX, VR NVL144, VR CPX\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLet’s move outside of the Rubin CPX chip and into the two new Vera Rubin racks that will host the CPX.\r\n\r\nIn March of last year, at GTC 2024, Nvidia presented the first generation of its Oberon Architecture: the GB200 NVL72. Fast forward a year and a half later, the second generation of Oberon, the GB300 NVL72, is about to ship in mass production volume. There are very few design changes and upgrades between the two generations. The third generation of Oberon architecture, Vera Rubin (VR), was the focus of Ian’s talk today at the AI Infra Summit. Available in 2026, less than three years after the debut of the Oberon rack-scale form factor, VR will see significant design changes and upgrades from GB200/GB300.\r\n\r\nVera Rubin Oberon pushes power density of the Oberon architecture to its limits, requiring a significant upgrade in power delivery content and design changes in cooling solutions. The cableless design is chosen with consideration to overcome the difficulties with routing flyover cables in the GB200/GB300 assembly & the reliability challenges that the intra-tray cables caused. The cables connecting the OSFP cages to the ConnectX NIC have been removed. Cables connecting from PCIe to the frontend Bluefield DPU & to local NVMe storage have also been removed amongst other side band cables.\r\n\r\nThe key changes and upgrades found in Vera Rubin are focused on a revamp of the following three Vera Rubin (VR) Compute Tray SKUs:\r\n\r\n* VR NVL144 (Rubin Only)\r\n* VR CPX (Rubin CPX Only)\r\n* VR NVL144 CPX (Rubin + Rubin CPX in same tray)\r\n\r\nThese three compute tray flavors are the building blocks for the three rack solutions discussed:\r\n\r\n* VR NVL144\r\n* VR NVL144 CPX\r\n* VR NVL144 + VR CPX (Dual Rack)\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis\r\n\r\nThe first rack presented was the VR NVL144 CPX. This is similar to the VR NVL144, except that for the VR NVL144 CPX, in each of the 18 Compute Trays, in addition to 4 R200 GPUs and 2 Vera CPUs, we now also have 8 Rubin CPX GPUs in each compute tray as well.\r\n\r\nThe VR NVL144 CPX rack will also be liquid cooled – but will have a much higher power budget at ~370kW vs the ~190kW for the VR NVL144.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia\r\n\r\nThe other deployment option is the Vera Rubin CPX Dual Rack. As the name suggests, this solution allows customers that will have deployed VR NVL144 racks to subsequently add VR CPX racks to their datacenter later, enabling specialized hardware for disaggregated PD inferencing. VR CPX is not connected via NVLink, hence the VR CPX rack does not contain NVSwitch Trays. The VR CPX rack is connected to the cluster through scale-out InfiniBand or Ethernet networking and can be added on subsequently to a cluster in a convenient physical location – it need not be physically adjacent to a VR NVL144.\r\n\r\nThe dual rack solution offers a lot more flexibility compared to VR NVL144 CPX as the customers can design the prefill to decode ratio to their likings. Also, not everyone’s datacenter infra will be ready for the ~370kW VR NVL144 CPX. In addition there is a smaller blast radius of failures compared to the single rack variant.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia\r\n\r\nIn the table below, we can see how much compute and networking content is crammed into one compute tray – a total of 22 Nvidia chips (14 of them being XPUs) in each compute tray, or 396 chips per VR NVL144 CPX rack. To cram all this content above into a single compute tray, Nvidia has moved to a cableless and modular design and is also redesigning the cooling loops within the compute tray.\r\n\r\nSource: Nvidia, SemiAnalysis Estimates\r\n\r\nThe NVL144 CPX will maintain a similar compute board set up as GB200/GB300 for the back half of the compute tray chassis. The notable difference is the adoption of socketable SOCAMM DRAM modules instead of soldered LPDDR5X for the memory that runs off the CPU. Most of the difference between VR NVL144 CPX and GB200/GB300 is in the front half of the chassis below the Host Processor Motherboard (‘HPM’) compute board, also known as the “Bianca” board for Blackwell generation.\r\n\r\nAt the front, the VR NVL144 CPX design is modular made up of 7 daughter card modules.\r\n\r\n* Four daughter card modules are placed on both sides of the chasis. Each side has two daughter cards stacked on top of each other. These four daughter cards each contain two 800G CX-9 NICs, one 1.6T OSFP cage, one E1.S SSD NVMe Module, and two Rubin CPXs.\r\n* One daughter card in the middle of the chassis (lower center of the diagram below) houses the Bluefield-4 Module, which contains one grace CPU and one CX-9 NIC.\r\n* One daughter card stacked on top of this Bluefield-4 module houses the power delivery board (PDB). The PDB is responsible for stepping down power from 48-54V to 12-13.5V as it enters the chassis from the busbar connector at the back.\r\n* The last daughter card is much smaller and is placed just to the right of the Bluefield-4 module. It is much slimmer and houses the utility management module containing items such as the BMC, HMC, DC-SCM, and management I/O.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia\r\n\r\nWe estimate the TDP of the Rubin CPX chip to be around 800W, though that rises to 880W in total when factoring in the whole module which contains the GDDR7 memory. To cool down the 7,040W of Rubin CPX modules at the front of the compute tray, the front of chassis cooling must be upgraded from air cooling to liquid cooling.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, NVIDIA has brought back a design from its 2009 GTX 295. The Rubin CPX and CX9 daughter cards are arranged in a sandwiched design with a shared liquid-cooled cold plate in between.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia\r\n\r\nOn the outer sides of the PCBs, heat pipes and heat spreaders transfer heat from the back of each clamshell GDDR7 memory modules to the main cold plate. Halving the compute tray area needed to house these GPUs by making full use of the 1U tray height and using both sides of the cold plate allows for maximum density.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia\r\n\r\nAnother key design change of VR NVL144 CPX is the adoption of cableless design. As we discussed in our PCB Supercycle Core Research note ( https://semianalysis.com/core-research/ai-server-pcb-super-cycle-copper-foil-content-upgrade/ ) as well as our recent Core Research note on Amphenol’s AI Content ( https://semianalysis.com/core-research/amphenol-content-growth-vr-nvl144-backplane-board-to-board-connectors-dac-acc-aec-tam-kyber-midplane-backplane/ ) , there are two reasons for this design. First, flyover cables present multiple different points of failure as they can easily be damaged during assembly. Second, the high-density design of VR NVL144 CPX leaves no space for cables to be routed.\r\n\r\n( https://semianalysis.com/core-research/ai-server-pcb-super-cycle-copper-foil-content-upgrade/ ) Aug 26, 2025\r\n\r\nAI Server PCB Super Cycle; Copper Foil Content Upgrade\r\n\r\nWega Chu, Doug OLaughlin\r\n\r\n( https://semianalysis.com/core-research/ai-server-pcb-super-cycle-copper-foil-content-upgrade/ )\r\n\r\nSo how are the signals routed without cables? The answer is simple: signals from the HPM (Bianca) board travel off the board via the Paladin board to board connector from Amphenol. This is discussed in more detail in our recent article on Amphenol’s AI Content ( https://semianalysis.com/core-research/amphenol-content-growth-vr-nvl144-backplane-board-to-board-connectors-dac-acc-aec-tam-kyber-midplane-backplane/ ). The signal is then routed through a PCB midplane sitting in the middle of the chassis. On the other side of the PCB midplane, the daughter cards connect to the PCB midplane via another set of Paladin B2B connectors.\r\n\r\n( https://semianalysis.com/core-research/amphenol-content-growth-vr-nvl144-backplane-board-to-board-connectors-dac-acc-aec-tam-kyber-midplane-backplane/ ) Sep 09, 2025\r\n\r\nAmphenol Content Growth – VR NVL144 Backplane/Board to Board Connectors, DAC/ACC/AEC TAM, Kyber Midplane/Backplane\r\n\r\nWega Chu, Daniel Nishball, Clara Ee, Patrick Zhou\r\n\r\n( https://semianalysis.com/core-research/amphenol-content-growth-vr-nvl144-backplane-board-to-board-connectors-dac-acc-aec-tam-kyber-midplane-backplane/ )\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia\r\n\r\nTo accommodate this cableless design, the CX-9 NICs on the upper part of the HPM (Bianca) board are moved from the back half to the front half of the chassis as illustrated in the diagram below. For the GB200/GB300, the PCIe signal distance between the GPU/CPU and the CX-7/8 is shorter than the Ethernet/Infiniband signal distance between the CX-7/8 and the OSFP cages.\r\n\r\nPreviously – having to transmit a 200G Ethernet/InfiniBand signal from the NIC in the back half of the compute tray to the OSFP cage in the front of the compute tray necessitated the use of flyover cables as the signal loss over PCB at 200Gbit/s (uni-directional) per lane is too high.\r\n\r\nBut now that the NIC is closer to the OSFP cage, the lower speed per lane PCIe Gen6 signals (64Gbit/s per lane uni-directional) travel the longer distance, and this connectivity can now be routed over PCB. Although it is still challenging to drive PCIe Gen6 signals over PCB, proper signal integrity can still be achieved by upgrading PCB materials.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates, Nvidia\r\n\r\nFor better serviceability, the daughter cards are also designed as a module. Each daughter card module can slide in and out of the daughter card module bay. Within the compute tray, there are internal rail kits designed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nBelow we show how the signals are routed within different Vera Rubin compute tray SKUs as well as the compute tray topology of the VR Rubin SKUs. One highlight from these diagrams is that CX-9 plays a critical role in enabling Rubin CPX and scale out connections, as it is an integrated PCIe switch too.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia Source: SemiAnalysis, Nvidia\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nThe Giant Leap: Disaggregated Serving\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nToday’s announcement of Rubin CPX is a game changer for inference, and its significance is surpassed only by the first announcement of the GB200 NVL72 Oberon rack-scale form factor. Only with hardware specialized to the very different phases of inference, prefill and decode, can disaggregated serving truly be attained.\r\n\r\nIn this section we will explain the evolution from traditional serving to disaggregated serving with uniform hardware and end with an analysis on disaggregated serving with specialized hardware. We will demonstrate how much waste is incurred by disaggregated serving with uniform hardware. Once specialized inference hardware becomes ubiquitous, using uniform hardware will feel like buying a jackhammer to squash a bug.\r\n\r\nAs we mentioned earlier in the article, the release of the Rubin CPX will send Nvidia’s competitors back to the drawing board to reshape their roadmaps. To not release a prefill specialized chip of their own will mean saddling their own customers with inefficient systems that will guarantee those customers will lose in the tokenomics marketplace.\r\n\r\nServing an LLM request involves two phases: the prefill phase and decode phase. In the prefill phase, the LLM generates the first token from the user prompt. This phase affects the time-to-first token (TTFT), and it is usually compute-bounded, under-utilizing the memory bandwidth. On the other hand, the decode phase generates a new token while loading the previous tokens from the KV cache. This phase affects time-per-output-token (TPOT), and it is always memory-bounded, under-utilizing the compute.\r\n\r\nSource: NVIDIA ( https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-nvidia-dynamo-a-low-latency-distributed-inference-framework-for-scaling-reasoning-ai-models/ ) Source: SemiAnalysis Estimates\r\n\r\nIn the chart below, we see an illustrative example highlighting the tradeoff between memory bandwidth and FLOPS utilization when conducting prefill and decode on the same system. The FLOPS required to prefill a single token scales linearly with respect to input sequence length. FLOPS requirements for decode also scales with respect to users on the system (i.e. batch size) and sequence lengths.\r\n\r\nA short input sequence length may not fully saturate the FLOPS available on an inference system, in which case the system’s output will be limited by the speed at which parameters can be loaded into chip memory – which is a function of memory bandwidth. As input sequence length increases, however, eventually the workload will grow to use all available FLOPS on the inference system, and the workload will be constrained by the total system FLOPS. In the right half of the chart below, we illustrate that when sequence length exceeds 32k, the FLOPS utilization reaches 100% while the memory bandwidth utilization drops.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis\r\n\r\nThus we can see that when a node is conducting a very prefill heavy workload – with long sequence lengths or large batch sizes, the memory bandwidth goes unutilized. As mentioned in the previous section, with the % of Chip BOM dedicated to memory increasing continually over the past few years, this ends up being a very expensive underutilization of resources!\r\n\r\nInefficiency also comes from the fact that the workload characteristics of the prefill and the decode phases are so inherently different that prefill and decode requests always interfere with each other’s performance when they are processed concurrently. There are many optimizations to try to balance both – for example adding prefill calculations to decide to ensure a somewhat uniform request length to improve utilization, but they always result in tradeoffs. Another approach is to separate the prefill and decode phases completely, but if you prioritize the decode phase, then your prefill will need to wait – resulting in a long time to first token. Conversely, if you prioritize prefill, your decode phase will be forced to wait and your inter-token latency will be slow as memory bandwidth then goes underutilized.\r\n\r\n*An Initial Step: Disaggregated Prefill and Decode with the Same Hardware*\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe first order solution is to implement disaggregated serving to first tackle the interference by routing prefill and decode requests to separate compute units, making it simpler to reason about performance. This has the benefit of being able to better manage service level agreements (SLAs) that tend to focus on a certain level of token/s/user. There are a few catches however. This complete disaggregation only seems to provide excellent results under certain input/output sequence length ratios and for long decode lengths, with other scenarios seeing underwhelming benefits. In addition, this disaggregation still leaves the “wrong sizing” problem whereby a pure prefill operation will almost always heavily underutilize memory bandwidth.\r\n\r\nIn the illustrative example below, we show how an R200 would hardly use much of its memory bandwidth when being used solely for prefill. As we increase sequence length and more efficiently use FLOPS available, the memory bandwidth utilization becomes increasingly minimal – effectively wasting very expensive HBM memory.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis\r\n\r\n*The Next Step: Disaggregated Prefill and Decode on Specialized Hardware – Enter the Rubin CPX*\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSince prefill is inherently going to underutilize memory bandwidth resources one approach to reduce wastage is to reduce the quantity and cost of the memory. This is exactly the approach the Rubin CPX has taken by using lower quantities of less expensive GDDR7 memory.\r\n\r\nIn the illustrative example below, we show how an R200 hardly use much of its memory bandwidth when being used solely for prefill. In contrast, the Rubin CPX actually utilizes a higher percent of its memory bandwidth at fairly short input lengths before dropping even further for input lengths that we would consider typical.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis\r\n\r\nIndeed, we stress this is not about efficiency for efficiency’s sake –and there is a huge impact to the bottom line! In the table below, we use provide an example to compare the memory bandwidth utilization for the R200 GPU and the Rubin CPX GPU. In this scenario, both suffer from very low memory bandwidth utilization, but the difference is that the Rubin CPX GPU is at least leaving lower quantities of far less expensive memory on the table. For the R200 – we see that the exact same prefill workload as is run on the CPX results in a $0.90/hr total cost of ownership wastage!\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis\r\n\r\nRubin CPX brings more memory capacity but the bits are “lower quality” as they are GDDR7, which is less than half the cost of HBM on a per GB basis. From a memory vendor perspective, GDDR7 is less margin because it is a less technically demanding product with more competition (i.e. Samsung can supply it).\r\n\r\nWhat this means is that the use of CPX systems lowers HBM’s share of total system content. For every dollar spent on the VR200 NVL144 CPX or a VR CPX rack, a lower share of that dollar is spent on HBM when compared to the same dollar spend on a standalone VR200 NVL144 rack. All else being equal, assuming a fixed dollar spent on AI systems, HBM demand per dollar spent will decline.\r\n\r\n*Why Not Just Reduce Memory Further?*\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMany readers are doubtless salivating at the idea of spending less on HBM and are thinking: Why not curtail the amount of memory in a system even further? If a typical prefill sequence length means a memory utilization of low double digits or even single digits – why not reduce memory capacity to 1/10 th the size? Does this mean doom for HBM demand and memory demand in general?\r\n\r\nSource: SoftRAM ( https://hackaday.com/2021/05/21/retrotechtacular-double-for-nothing/ )\r\n\r\nHowever, things are not so simple in technology. What Rubin CPX does is reduce the cost of pre-fill and tokens. Lower cost of tokens increases demand, which means more demand for decode increases as well. Like many other technological innovations that drive down cost, increases in demand usually more than offsets a drop in cost, netting out to a higher total dollar market size.\r\n\r\nThere are additional supply chain implications of this GDDR7 demand. The RTX Pro 6000 also uses GDDR7 but at a lower 28Gbps speed. Nvidia has put in huge supply chain orders for the RTX Pro SKU, with the original plan being to sell chips to China as a replacement for the H20 before export licenses for the H20 were reissued. These orders were primarily placed with Samsung, who had the capacity to meet these sudden rush orders. SK Hynix and Micron were not able to meet this demand as their wafer capacity was tied up to serve their HBM orders among other things. As Samsung can deliver competitive GDDR7, Samsung could similarly benefit from the Rubin CPX.\r\n\r\n*More on Prefill Pipeline Parallelism: One Interesting Upside of Disaggregated Prefill with the Rubin CPX*\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn the prior section we outlined how the Rubin CPX reduces memory wastage, but Rubin CPX foregoes the use of very fast scale-up network capabilities solutions such as NVLink is another key saving. Rubin CPX’s off-chip I/O is limited to 16 lanes of PCIe Gen6 which is approximately 1Tbit/s of unidirectional bandwidth vs 14.4Tbit/s of NVLink for R200. This is enough I/O for performing prefill even for modern MoE frontier LLMs.\r\n\r\nFor instance, DeepSeek V3 when running on the NVFP4 number format will require 335GB of memory capacity to load all the model weights – this exceeds the 128GB of memory capacity of a single CPX chip. This can be overcome by using pipeline parallelism (‘PP’), where multiple layers of a model are split across different GPUs. In PP, each GPU processes tokens sequentially and will pass activations down the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of PP is that the tokens are passed sequentially across many GPUs, incurring latency from inter-stage communications. The important implication is that PP will tend to deliver higher token throughput per GPU than Expert Parallelism (EP), but the tradeoff is that PP suffers from a higher time to first token (TTFT) than EP. PP has higher tok/s/gpu throughput because EP has high communications overhead as it involves all-to-all collective operations vs a simple send and receive operation in the case of PP.\r\n\r\nSo, for pipeline parallel inference, the simpler communications requirements mean that prefill will almost never saturate communications links – meaning there is no need to provision expensive fast scale-up networking. Like with HBM, this is another area where one can find savings by peeling away yet another layer of equipment that goes unused during prefill-only operations – sparing the system owner wasted TCO dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the table below, we show that prefill for DeepSeek using a parallelism scheme of PP8 or PP4 results in a message size per token of 7kB. If we were to fully saturate the PCIe Gen6 x16 lanes of I/O with messages, this means we could at most transmit (and therefore process) 18.3M tokens per second. This is the communications bound.\r\n\r\nTurning to the compute bound scenario, we see that prefill FLOP per token is 0.074 TFLOP. So, if we divide the Rubin CPX’s dense FP4 throughput of 19,800 PFLOPS by 0.074 TFLOP, we arrive a maximum token throughput of 267.6k tokens/second.\r\n\r\nThis is far below the communications bound and vastly under saturates even a fairly vanilla PCIe Gen6 I/O let alone NVLink which delivers over 14x the bandwidth of 16 lanes of PCIe Gen6.\r\n\r\nWe estimate that the total NVLink Scale-up cost to the end system owner (inclusive of NVSwitches and Backplane) stands at around ~$8k per GPU – which is just over 10% of the all-in cluster cost per GPU. This is the other dimension along which Rubin CPX delivers considerable savings to the end user.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis\r\n\r\nHowever, attempting to use Expert Parallelism with lower speed networking connectivity will lead to latency issues and bottlenecks. Communications need scale with respect to the product of top_k times number of layers. DeepSeek V3 has a top_k of 8 and has 61 layers, so a back of the envelope calculation would indicate that using EP over PP would increase communications requirements by ~488x.\r\n\r\n*One More Thing on Scaling and Huang’s Law*\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nToday’s discussion focused on metrics for inference using the NVFP4 number format. Indeed, inference providers have been continually unlocking more throughput by pulling the level of adopting lower and lower precision number formats. However – once we are at FP4 – we will start to run out of juice to squeeze.\r\n\r\nSparsity has been presented as another lever to pull to keep unlocking more throughput, a key reason why most marketing specifications and decks communicate in terms of Sparse TFLOPS, however sparsity has yet to actually deliver the promised benefits – falling well short of the 2x pickup it promises.\r\n\r\nToday’s announcement also unveiled sparsity for Rubin. This sparsity scheme is unlike the 2:4 structured sparsity used in Hopper and Ampere, and it isn’t like Blackwell’s 4:8 pairwise structured sparsity either. We hope Rubin Sparsity is able to yield meaningful throughput benefits and keep Huang’s law on track!\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\nDownsides of Hardware-specialized Disaggregated Serving\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs exciting as the advent of prefill specialized chips are, we have not yet reached Nirvana, and hardware specialized disaggregated serving comes with its downsides too. As a provider’s workloads and models change, it is crucial for them to be able to change the prefill to decode instance ratio (PD ratio).\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nWhat Now For Custom Silicon?\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe optimum PD ratio is sensitive to numerous factors, including model architecture, SLA, networking bandwidth, etc. However, one key disadvantage of the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX is that it has a fixed number and ratio of Rubin and Rubin CPX chips, which makes it less flexible should one wish to change the PD ratio.\r\n\r\nNvidia’s agility in evolving chips is shifting the landscape rapidly around its competitors. Just as soon as competitors are in striking distance of parity in terms of performance or architecture, Nvidia evolves its products along another dimension. Let’s discuss how widespread adoption of Rubin CPX GPU could impact competing solutions.\r\n\r\nGoogle TPU\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe TPU’s 3D Torus scale-up network provides a unique advantage in that it allows a maximum pod size of up to 9,216 TPUs. This is the largest world size in the industry, yet it offers some of the lowest scale-up networking cost per accelerator. This enables a very broad array of parallelism schemes that other smaller world sizes might not support.\r\n\r\nWith that said, it would be ideal for Google to develop a prefill only chip to continue to maintain their performance per dollar advantage for internal workloads. They have the internal workloads to generate anchor demand to bootstrap and fund the development of a prefill-only chip that can also be later marketed for external use.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s unique topology means that there will be certain inference system configurations and models where performance may even exceed that of certain Nvidia systems.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nAWS Trainium3 Max NVL72, AWS EFA NICs and Meta MTIAv4 SUE72\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSystems from providers that have internal workloads but are pursuing designs that emulate the NVL72 rack form factor form another category. These providers also have the internal workloads to bootstrap the development of prefill only chips, and it is ideal for them to do so in order to remain at parity with Nvidia’s VR200 NVL144 CPX.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a prefill only chip for use in conjunction with the Trainium3 Teton-3 Max NL72 (featuring a 72-logical GPU with all to all switched scale-up size just like the VR200 NVL144) can lean on Anthropic’s demand to codesign and gain adoption for their inference workloads.\r\n\r\nThere will be major time to market challenges for AWS for its VR 144 CPX due to the fact that their 1U compute tray is already tightly integrated and packed with 4 large Rubin  GPU packages and 8 CPX GPU packages leaving no space to add AWS’s custom EFA NICs into the compute tray. Amazon does not want to use ConnectX-9. AWS LOVES EFA!\r\n\r\nWe believe that they will continue using EFA and overcome this challenge by disaggregating their EFA NICs into an EFA NIC only sidecar rack and use external PCIe AEC cables to connect between the VR 144 CPX rack and the EFA NIC only sidecar rack. Furthermore, since they will not use the ConnectX-9 NIC, which has an integrated PCIe switch, they would also need to use Astera Labs’ dedicated PCIe switches to connect between the Vera CPU, local NVMe, Rubin CPX GPU as well as the external PCIe AEC cable to the EFA NIC in the sidecar rack.\r\n\r\nMTIAv4’s SUE72 (featuring a 72-logical GPU with all to all switched scale-up size just like the VR200 NVL144) design similarly can lean on Meta internal inference workloads. Even emerging designs such as OpenAI’s chip with Broadcom stand to compete given they will be codesigned with Frontier Models in mind and with an internal workload as a backstop.\r\n\r\nDespite enjoying the benefit of internal demand, the MTIAv3 is excluded from this category due to its small 16 GPU world size. It will effectively now need to develop prefill-only silicon to even have a shot at parity with upcoming Nvidia systems.\r\n\r\nAMD MI400 Series UALoE72 and MI500 UAL256\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHowever, with the launch of Rubin CPX GPU, AMD’s comeback strategy is now looking to be not fast or aggressive, and AMD will find itself chasing Nvidia once again. AMD was about to catch up with the rack scale MI400, but Nvidia raised the bar.\r\n\r\nThe key difference between AMD and the aforementioned providers is AMD’s lack of robust internal workloads to provide the revenue and demand backstop for yet another chip development project just to keep up.\r\n\r\nAMD had made waves earlier this year with its Advancing AI Event where it debuted its MI400 72 GPU rack scale system. Our analysis at the time ( https://semianalysis.com/2025/06/13/amd-advancing-ai-mi350x-and-mi400-ualoe72-mi500-ual256/ ) pointed out that the MI400 could offer a lower total cost of ownership relative to FP4 FLOPS than a VR200 NVL144 system – all while providing 19.8TB/s of memory bandwidth vs the 13.0 TB/s of memory bandwidth initially advertised for the VR200 NVL144.\r\n\r\nNvidia’s VR200 NVL144 is now advertising a memory bandwidth of ~20.5TB/s per logical GPU by requesting much faster speed bins from their suppliers. VR200 memory bandwidth now matches that of the AMD MI400 with fewer HBM sites.\r\n\r\nSource: SemiAnalysis AI TCO Model ( https://semianalysis.com/ai-cloud-tco-model/ )\r\n\r\nIf the MI400’s FP4 effective dense FLOPS (i.e. what microbenchmarks will actually deliver in performance as opposed to marketed throughput) turns out to be on par with or lower than the VR200 NVL144, AMD will effectively show up later than Nvidia to market with a carbon copy of the VR200 NVL144. Meanwhile, Nvidia will yet again pull ahead as the VR200 CPX NVL144 delivers better performance per TCO for long context lengths. AMD will then have to wait again until 2027 to catch up.\r\n\r\nHowever, we believe that AMD remains in war mode, and it now needs to open another front to fight the prefill only silicon battle on top of developing their rack scale system and improving their software to have a shot at catching up with Nvidia by 2027.\r\n\r\n------\r\nNvidia\r\n------\r\n\r\nLastly – why should Nvidia stop at only having a prefill focused chip – why not a decode focused chip as well? Nvidia has so far only debuted a prefill focused chip, and the decode step stays with the existing R200 chip rather than a decode specialized SKU.\r\n\r\nA decode specialized chip would be the opposite of the prefill chip: skinny compute, fat on memory bandwidth. This chip would look like a R200 but without the need for as much compute. Ideally, I/O would be preserved for both memory and off-package I/O by maintaining the size of the I/O chiplets, but the edges of the main compute die facing the I/O dies can be reduced, whilst keeping the same edge to fit 2 HBM site per edge. The result is a much smaller compute die.\r\n\r\nAdditional savings could be also had from a significant increase in parametric yields with a lot of defeatured SMs as well as much TDP reducing costs associated with power delivery and thermal management. This is the opposite of the case of the pre-fill chip where the amount of HBM is preserved, while there are reductions in other parts of the system, bringing HBM’s share of BOM back up.\r\n\r\nSubscribe to get access\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nRead more of this content when you subscribe today.\r\n\r\nLog In ( https://semianalysis.com/wp-json/passport/v1/oauth/authlogin )\r\n\r\nSubscription Information\r\n\r\nMember: Subscriber\r\nEmail: kelan@bytedance.com\r\n\r\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to SemiAnalysis ( https://semianalysis.com/wp-json/passport/v1/oauth/refresh ).\r\n\r\nClick here ( https://semianalysis.passport.online/member/account ) to view your account, manage your subscriptions, or unsubscribe from emails.\r\n\r\n© 2025 SemiAnalysis LLC ( https://semianalysis.com/wp-json/passport/v1/oauth/refresh )",

Instead of a static snapshot, you’ll see a timeline that shows when growth happens and what’s driving it.\r\nWhat you’ll see:\r\nTimeline of growth: Track spikes in revenue, subscribers, and traffic over time. Markers along the bottom let you correlate audience activity to the posts you publish.\r\nGranular source breakdowns: See which specific platforms are responsible for your growth. This includes both Substack sources like Notes and Recommendations and links from other Substacks (Trackbacks), as well as external platforms like Instagram and Google search.\r\nBehind-the-scenes improvements: We’ve made your stats more accurate and consistent across your dashboard, emails, and CRM. You may notice some numbers being distributed differently across sources, but your revenue and subscriber counts are completely unchanged. You’re now seeing a more accurate picture of where your growth comes from.\r\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve your dashboard, we’ve updated the Home tab to highlight essential metrics like revenue, subscriber count, and inbound traffic. All your other stats are still available in the Stats tab.\r\nLearn more: A guide to Substack metrics [ https://substack.com/redirect/ca3cd7f8-7c07-430d-9de6-f9c73ccb642f?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]\r\nNew tools to accelerate growth\r\nWe're also making it easier to reach new subscribers. Now after you publish, you’ll receive ready-to-share social assets for Instagram Stories, Facebook, and more.\r\nBrianCantStopEating , author of Let's Eat! , has been using the new sharing assets to let his followers on other platforms know when he publishes on Substack:\r\n“As a newer creator, having a seamless way to share my Substack updates to my other communities is a game changer!”\r\nTry them today\r\nOpen your dashboard to explore the new growth chart, and promote your next post with the new social sharing assets.

A single round cut short a public debate and turned it into a political assassination.\r\nSean Spicer [ https://substack.com/redirect/b0e9cb0f-9eba-43db-9f6a-89de0877ec9f?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: I could talk about the insanity that this was allowed to happen; that it’s taken over 24 hours to find the culprit; the disgraceful coverage by the media; the despicable comments making the rounds on social media. But the sad truth is that none of that will bring him back.\r\nAndrew Egger [ https://substack.com/redirect/82c206c2-69b5-4475-9fce-54293866eebe?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: The summer of 2025 had already been a season of alarming political violence—the May killing of two young employees of Israel’s D.C. embassy, the June shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers and their families, the firebombing of a pro-Israel march in Colorado, the August shooting at the Centers for Disease Control.\r\nRoss Barkan [ https://substack.com/redirect/e34e64ff-3115-4b29-bffb-4ec604e7b17c?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: I do have a suspicion, yet to be confirmed, that we are exiting the mass shooting era and returning to the kinds of high-profile, individuated assassinations that defined so much of the last century. There have been so many mass shootings, especially at schools, that a killer can’t find much notoriety anymore. We collectively remember Adam Lanza, Elliot Rodger, and James Holmes, or maybe the Columbine kids, but Salvador Ramos, who murdered nineteen students and two teachers at Uvalde, draws a blank. Luigi Mangione, of course, is now globally famous, and he only needed to kill one person who was not famous at all.\r\nRyan James Girdusky [ https://substack.com/redirect/be72fb5f-bfe2-4bec-abbb-fc6c8d6a7f93?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: It feels like we are in the midst of a political turmoil that we haven’t seen in decades. Still, unlike the days of rage in the 1960s and the landslide elections of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan that created a consensus in this country, there’s a money-making machine that feeds people’s anxieties, fears, and paranoia.\r\nProspect Magazine [ https://substack.com/redirect/14f6c7bb-e24d-4842-9ffb-69954bf7d35e?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: [P]olitical violence is hardly new (particularly in America), but a distinctive variety has emerged: “stochastic” violence, defined by the “general and vague encouragement” of violence via social media and other networks. Individuals who were radicalised online were responsible for the killings of political figures including Jo Cox and Minnesota politician Melissa Hortman.\r\nAndrew Egger [ https://substack.com/redirect/82c206c2-69b5-4475-9fce-54293866eebe?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: The reactions [to Kirk’s murder] played out online much as you’d expect. Horrified leaders of both parties issued statements condemning political violence and issuing condolences to Kirk’s family. Below that seethed the eternal, inescapable culture war, each side excoriating the other. It barely mattered how representative of their broader political cohorts these posters were; every American’s social-media algorithms made sure they got to see whichever ones would make them maddest.\r\nNoah Smith [ https://substack.com/redirect/abe1a809-5661-4d2f-8dfe-3e1444318d03?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: On anonymous platforms like X and Bluesky, the marginal cost of calling anyone and everyone a Nazi is zero, so everyone calls everyone a Nazi. And malignant trolls get attention and status by whipping up fear and extremism. Of course, rightists do this too. The result is a constant toxic mix of alarmism and extremism, no matter where you sit on the political spectrum.\r\nAndrew Egger [ https://substack.com/redirect/82c206c2-69b5-4475-9fce-54293866eebe?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: The same fight, too, could be seen on cable news.\r\nAaron Everitt [ https://substack.com/redirect/b2a18500-b8dc-4480-8c85-c566b42dcb74?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: When debate is silenced, it does something unnatural to the human experience. When that debate is silenced because of violence, it feels even more disjointed from the human experience.\r\nAlexis Coe [ https://substack.com/redirect/eb358536-9ec8-4d61-b4d2-9e162c473f55?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Already, Americans speak casually of “civil war,” march in armed rallies, and wink at political violence as if it were just another tactic.\r\nNoah Smith [ https://substack.com/redirect/abe1a809-5661-4d2f-8dfe-3e1444318d03?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: I still think the probability of an actual American civil war is relatively low, but if it does happen, it won’t be rifle battles in an empty field like last time—it’ll be more like the Spanish Civil War, with neighbors fighting neighbors, rampant atrocities on both sides, and the nation impoverished for many years.\r\nAlexis Coe [ https://substack.com/redirect/eb358536-9ec8-4d61-b4d2-9e162c473f55?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Political violence, [George Washington] warned, does not start with mobs or bayonets. It begins with citizens who come to see those with different views as enemies—encouraged by parties who mistake retribution as rule. In his “Farewell Address,” Washington warned, “The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension. . .is itself a frightful despotism.”\r\nDan Pfeiffer [ https://substack.com/redirect/2f6772dd-e92f-4594-b26a-f179d5beb461?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Democracy cannot function if people can’t participate in the political process without fear of violence. Political violence begets more violence, as more and more people seek retribution. This is when the system collapses and people begin to lose their rights and freedoms.\r\nJeff Maurer [ https://substack.com/redirect/0ed576cf-21ac-430b-bf1a-b0f547c8e055?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: [A]nyone who values the hard-earned progress that humanity has made separating political power from physical power should view this as a tragedy on a human and a societal level.\r\nMatthew Continetti [ https://substack.com/redirect/3e4fa7fb-3fe8-49bc-96f2-728c74d2e0c9?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: The fact that Kirk was killed on a college campus is grimly symbolic.\r\nAngel Eduardo [ https://substack.com/redirect/0ee60c96-2613-4d99-8f09-e4d860a51179?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: The data is grim. More college students than ever believe that, at least in some rare circumstances, it can be acceptable for their peers to engage in violence to stop speech they don’t like. This is extremely troubling, because violence in response to speech is how our culture of free expression—and the civil society it creates—begins to crumble completely. When it comes to violence, even “rarely” is too often.\r\nJeff Maurer [ https://substack.com/redirect/0ed576cf-21ac-430b-bf1a-b0f547c8e055?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: Kirk was prominent because large numbers of people wanted to hear what he had to say, but he’s been removed by someone who feels that they should have the power to dictate the content of our national dialogue. And, sadly, they do have that power—the shooter just used violence to make a decision that we all now have to live with. We’re subject to the whims of someone willing to use violence to achieve their goals, just like when brigands were stealing our sad little peasant pot and shoe.\r\nAndrew Egger [ https://substack.com/redirect/82c206c2-69b5-4475-9fce-54293866eebe?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: I don’t know what we can do to avoid this fate. All I know is what I can do. And what I can do starts with the acknowledgment that, while Charlie Kirk may have been an ideological opponent, he wasn’t my enemy. My enemy—an enemy I share with many who would call themselves my enemy—is the person who shot him, and anyone else who would reach for violence as a means to a political end.\r\nJeremiah Johnson (quoted by Andrew Egger) [ https://substack.com/redirect/82c206c2-69b5-4475-9fce-54293866eebe?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: As much as you can, resist the hysteria. Refuse to participate in it, refuse to make the polarization worse. The purpose of liberalism is to allow us to disagree with someone without discriminating against them, without harassing them, without killing them. It’s a precious thing, perhaps the most precious thing our civilization has achieved. Every time you break bread in peace with an outsider, every time a Catholic and Protestant shake hands, it’s a miracle. Don’t take it for granted.\r\nHelen Pluckrose [ https://substack.com/redirect/6272336b-5b8e-49c3-983a-3124cf3ab4f7?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: The task before us is simple, but not easy. We must be both angry and saddened at the taking of a man’s life without making him a token. We must reject political violence consistently without resorting to tribalism. We must defend, without compromise, the principle that every human being has the right to speak without fear of death. If we can do this—on the left, on the right, and in the centre—we affirm both the freedoms and the humanity of those with whom we disagree and of those with whom we agree and the liberty that must endure for us all.\r\nMatthew Continetti [ https://substack.com/redirect/3e4fa7fb-3fe8-49bc-96f2-728c74d2e0c9?j=eyJ1IjoiM3VnMG5rIn0.7LenPBzSktkzQFZLMlQUnkrh0Kov9oMFGCIfU1yoPqk ]: The murder of Charlie Kirk could yet serve as a turning point. It could be an occasion for Americans to step away from the abyss and recover the moral clarity and habits of heart that sustain a republic. But if we fail—if the moment passes, if the tit for tat escalates, if we retreat from the public square into our private redoubts—then the abyss won’t recede. It will widen. And America will be one step closer to the edge.\r\nBecause of the sensitive subject matter—and in hopes of turning down the temperature of the online debate—we will not be allowing comments on this post.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.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.ES8jj3jlWsnDNFCaI_iyZZ-FDkccL8nhZ4DZjBULF0M?",
